Improved Heart of Fury Mode
By OlvynChuru

This readme describes the optional components of the mod.

- Change the summoning limit

This component lets you either remove the summoning limit (so you can summon as many creatures as you want) or set it to a value of your choice.


- Modify Fighting Styles

This component improves the bonuses granted by Single Weapon Style, Two-Handed Weapon Style, Sword and Shield Style, and Two Weapon Style. It also allows a character to take up to five points in a style if that class/kit could normally take the maximum number of points in a style. For example, warriors can now take up to five points in each style, and Swashbucklers and Blades can now take up to five points in Two Weapon Style.

Here's what the fighting styles now do:

SINGLE-WEAPON: This fighting style is for characters who do not wish to use a shield but want some bonus when using a one-handed melee weapon.

Proficient (1 slot): The wielder gets a +1 bonus to THAC0, a -1 bonus to Speed Factor, and the ability to score critical hits on a roll of 19 or 20 when using a one-handed weapon.

Specialized (2 slots): The wielder gets a +2 bonus to THAC0, a -2 bonus to Speed Factor, and the ability to score critical hits on a roll of 18 to 20 when using a one-handed weapon.

Master (3 slots): The wielder gets a +3 bonus to THAC0, a -3 bonus to Speed Factor, and the ability to score critical hits on a roll of 17 to 20 when using a one-handed weapon.

High Master (4 slots): The wielder gets a +4 bonus to THAC0, a -4 bonus to Speed Factor, and the ability to score critical hits on a roll of 16 to 20 when using a one-handed weapon.

Grand Master (5 slots): The wielder gets a +5 bonus to THAC0, a -5 bonus to Speed Factor, and the ability to score critical hits on a roll of 15 to 20 when using a one-handed weapon.~

TWO-HANDED: This fighting style allows the character to use a two-handed melee weapon and receive special bonuses.

Proficient (1 slot): The wielder gets a +2 bonus to damage rolls and a -1 bonus to Speed Factor.

Specialized (2 slots): The wielder gets a +3 bonus to damage rolls, a -2 bonus to Speed Factor, and the ability to score critical hits on a roll of 19 or 20 when using a two-handed weapon.

Master (3 slots): The wielder gets a +5 bonus to damage rolls, a -3 bonus to Speed Factor, and the ability to score critical hits on a roll of 19 or 20 when using a two-handed weapon.

High Master (4 slots): The wielder gets a +6 bonus to damage rolls, a -4 bonus to Speed Factor, and the ability to score critical hits on a roll of 18 to 20 when using a two-handed weapon.

High Master (5 slots): The wielder gets a +8 bonus to damage rolls, a -5 bonus to Speed Factor, and the ability to score critical hits on a roll of 18 to 20 when using a two-handed weapon.

SWORD AND SHIELD: Anyone can pick up a shield and get its basic protection bonuses, but by spending slots on this fighting style, an adventurer can maximize the benefits received.

Proficient (1 slot): The wielder gets a +1 bonus to AC against all weapons, and an additional +2 bonus to AC against missile weapons.

Specialized (2 slots): The wielder gets a +2 bonus to AC against all weapons, and an additional +4 bonus to AC against missile weapons.

Master (3 slots): The wielder gets a +3 bonus to AC against all weapons, and an additional +6 bonus to AC against missile weapons.

High Master (4 slots): The wielder gets a +4 bonus to AC against all weapons, and an additional +8 bonus to AC against missile weapons.

Grand Master (5 slots): The wielder gets a +5 bonus to AC against all weapons, and an additional +10 bonus to AC against missile weapons.

NOTE: Despite the name of this style, any one-handed melee weapon in combination with a shield will receive the aforementioned bonuses.

TWO-WEAPON: This fighting style allows the character to use two melee weapons at the same time with fewer penalties. A character wielding two weapons without a slot in this fighting style would incur a -4 penalty to attack rolls with the main weapon and a -8 penalty with the off-hand weapon.

Proficient (1 slot): The wielder's penalties are reduced to -2 with the main weapon and -6 with the off-hand weapon.

Specialized (2 slots): The wielder's penalties are reduced to 0 with the main weapon and -4 with the off-hand weapon.

Master (3 slots): The wielder's penalties are reduced to 0 with the main weapon and -2 with the off-hand weapon.

High Master (4 slots): The wielder gets no penalties from wielding two weapons.

Grand Master (5 slots): The wielder gets no penalties from wielding two weapons and gets a +1 bonus to AC while doing so.


- Disable the normal Heart of Fury Mode bonuses

This component makes it so nobody gets those ridiculous HP and AC bonuses that creatures normally get on Heart of Fury Mode.


- Class and Kit Enhancements

This component increases the level cap to 50 and overhauls many classes and kits so that they get more interesting abilities, many of which will scale all the way to level 50. This is meant to make single-classed characters more viable. In a six-character party with double experience enabled, a single-classed character will reach level 50 by the end of the game, but a multi-classed character won't (so a single-classed character will get extra bonuses that a multi-classed character won't obtain).

Here are all the changes to classes and kits:

Fighters and fighter kits (excluding Barbarians) now get an additional 5% chance to critically hit at level 20 and every 5 levels thereafter.

The Berserker Enrage ability has been changed substantially:

ENRAGE: The character becomes enraged for 1 turn. While enraged, all slashing, piercing, and crushing damage dealt by the character is increased by 50%, but all physical damage taken by the character is also increased by 50%. The character also becomes immune to charm, confusion, fear, feeblemind, hold, imprisonment, level drain, maze, stun, and sleep.

Wizard Slayers now gain +5% magic resistance per level and can use certain magic items whose purpose is largely to protect against magic (e.g. Potions of Magic Protection/Blocking/Shielding).

The Kensai Kai ability now lasts a number of seconds equal to the character's Wisdom. Also, Kensai can now wear bracers and gauntlets. Their bonuses to hit and damage rolls keep increasing up to level 48.

Barbarians now keep rolling their full d12 for HP each level even after level 9. Starting at level 31, their Hit Die changes to a d20, though they don't gain Hit Points retroactively from this.

The Dwarven Defender Defensive Stance ability now only lasts 4 rounds and reduces movement speed by 80%. It still gives +50% physical damage resistance, so it should still be useful.

Rangers and Paladins now learn spells faster. They get their first 1st-level spell slot at level 2, and they gain access to a higher spell level every 3 levels thereafter (2nd-level spells at level 5, 3rd-level spells at level 8, 4th-level spells at level 11, 5th-level spells at level 4, and 6th-level spells at level 17).

All spellcasters (Mages, Sorcerers, Bards, Clerics, Druids, Rangers, Paladins) now continue to gain spell slots each level all the way up to level 50.

Archers can no longer cast ranger spells. However, their bonuses to hit and damage rolls with missile weapons keep increasing up to level 48, and their Called Shot ability gets better as well:

CALLED SHOT: All successful ranged attacks within the next 10 seconds have the following cumulative effects besides normal damage, according to the level of the Archer:
 4th level: -1 penalty to target's THAC0.
 8th level: -1 penalty to target's Saving Throws vs. Spell.
 12th level: -1 penalty to the target's Strength score.
 16th level: +2 bonus to damage roll.
 20th level: Will critically hit on a roll of 18-20.
 30th level: Will critically hit on a roll of 16-20.
 40th level: Will critically hit on a roll of 14-20.
 50th level: Target must Save vs. Death or die instantly.

Stalkers can achieve better backstabs, sneak attacks, and crippling strikes:

- May backstab, although for a lower damage multiplier than Thieves:
  Level 1-8: x2
  Level 9-16: x3
  Level 17-26: x4
  Level 27+: x5
- If 3E Sneak Attack is enabled, may sneak attack instead of backstab for increased damage. Attacking a creature from behind deals +1d6 damage, and an additional +1d6 for every 3 ranger levels after level 1.
- If 3E Sneak Attack is enabled, may deal crippling strikes upon successful sneak attacks. Crippling strikes last for 1 turn and have the following effects:
  Level 6-11: -1 to target's hit and damage rolls
  Level 12-17: -2 to target's hit and damage rolls
  Level 18-23: -3 to target's hit and damage rolls
  Level 24-29: -4 to target's hit and damage rolls
  Level 30-35: -5 to target's hit and damage rolls
  Level 36-41: -6 to target's hit and damage rolls
  Level 42-47: -7 to target's hit and damage rolls
  Level 48+: -8 to target's hit and damage rolls

They no longer gain the spells Haste, Minor Spell Deflection or Protection from Normal Missiles; instead they gain these spells:

- 5th level: May cast the spell Invisibility as a 2nd-level spell.
- 11th level: May cast the spell Improved Invisibility as a 4th-level spell.
- 17th level: May cast the spell Mislead as a 6th-level spell.

Beast Masters have been completely overhauled:

BEAST MASTER: This Ranger is a wanderer and is not comfortable in civilized lands. Therefore, <PRO_HESHE> maintains a natural affinity for animals; they are <PRO_HISHER> friends and comrades-in-arms, and the Beast Master has a limited form of telepathic communication with them.

Advantages:
- May use Find Familiar ability to summon a pseudo dragon (if lawful or neutral good) or fairy dragon (if chaotic good) companion.
- Allied animals within 30 feet of the Beastmaster gain +2 to hit and damage. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 levels.
- The Beastmaster's familiar gains +4 to hit and damage while within 30 feet of the Beastmaster. These bonuses increase by 2 every 3 levels.
- 2th level: May cast Animal Summoning I as a 1st-level spell.
- 5th level: May cast Animal Summoning II as a 2nd-level spell.
- 8th level: May cast Animal Summoning III as a 3rd-level spell.
- 20th level: Allied animals and familiars within 30 feet of the Beastmaster also gain an additional attack per round.
- 40th level: Allied animals and familiars within 30 feet of the Beastmaster now gain two additional attacks per round.


Disadvantages:
- May not wear any metal armor.
- May not use any metal weapons (for example: swords, halberds, war hammers, or morning stars).

Paladins and paladin kits (except for Blackguards and Undead Hunters) now gain an additional +1 to all saving throws every 5 levels. The Paladin Smite Evil ability now deals 1d8 magic damage per level (max 50d8) to an evil target (with no Saving Throw, and Magic Resistance cannot stop it). The Paladin Lay on Hands ability now scales up to level 50, and Paladins now gain an extra use of it every 5 levels.

The Cavalier's hit and damage bonuses against demons, devils, dragons and wyverns have been increased to +6.

Inquisitors can now cast Breach once per day starting at level 10; they get an additional use of Breach every 10 levels thereafter. Since regular Paladins can get Dispel Magic earlier thanks to their improved spellcasting, I wanted to give Inquisitors something special.

When an Undead Hunter hits an undead creature with a melee or ranged attack, there is now a 2% per level chance that the undead will be turned as if the Undead Hunter had used Turn Undead on it.

The Blackguard Absorb Health ability now scales up to level 50, as does their Aura of Despair:

  3rd level: Enemies within 15 ft. receive a -1 penalty to hit and damage rolls and a -2 penalty to Armor Class for 1 turn.
  6th level: Enemies within 15 ft. receive a -2 penalty to hit and damage rolls and a -2 penalty to Armor Class for 1 turn.

  30th Level: Enemies within 15 ft. receive a -4 penalty to hit and damage rolls and a -4 penalty to Armor Class for 1 turn, and must Save vs. Breath at -3 or run away for the duration.

  50th Level: Enemies within 15 ft. receive a -6 penalty to hit and damage rolls and a -6 penalty to Armor Class for 1 turn, and must Save vs. Breath at -7 or run away for the duration.

The Priest of Talos Lightning Bolt ability is now Talos Bolt:

TALOS BOLT: This spell fires a bolt of lightning at the target, similar to the Lightning Bolt spell, except that the damage is not capped at 10d6, dealing as much as 50d6 damage from a 50th level caster.

The Priest of Helm Seeker Sword ability has been improved:

SEEKING SWORD: This spell creates a sword in the Cleric's hand that cannot be dropped or unequipped. The sword is enchanted as a +4 weapon, provides a +100 THAC0 bonus, and will not critically miss. It deals 2d4+4 damage to any target it hits and dispels Mirror Image, Invisibility, and Improved Invisibility effects on the target. The weapon sets the Cleric's number of attacks per round to 3 and lasts for 1 round per level.

The Priest of Lathander Boon of Lathander ability has been changed:

BOON OF LATHANDER: This spell lasts 1 hour. It protects all creatures within 15 feet of the caster from level drain and many other effects of undead creatures' attacks, such as shadows' Strength drain.

The Priest of Tyr Divine Favor ability now lasts 1 turn and scales up to level 48.

The Priest of Tempus Chaos of Battle ability now scales up to level 48.

Totemic Druids now summon more powerful spirit animals at higher levels:

SUMMON SPIRIT ANIMAL: The Totemic Druid summons a special spirit animal (spirit bear, spirit wolf, spirit lion, or spirit snake) to aid <PRO_HIMHER> for 6 turns. The spirit animal has 1 HD at level 1, 3 HD at level 3, 5 HD at level 5, 7 HD at level 7, 10 HD at level 10, 15 HD at level 20, 20 HD at level 30, 25 HD at level 40, and 30 HD at level 50.

Avengers now also gain Delayed Blast Fireball as a 7th-level spell.

Thieves and thief kits now gain the ability to use any item at level 28.

Monks and monk kits have been overhauled:

MONK: Monks are warriors who pursue perfection through contemplation as well as action. They are versatile fighters, especially skilled in combat without weapons or armor. Though Monks cannot cast spells, they have a unique magic of their own: they channel a subtle energy, called ki, which allows them to perform amazing feats. The Monk's best known feat is their ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed blow.

CLASS FEATURES:

- May not wear any armor.

- May only become Proficient (one slot) in any weapon class.
- May only become Proficient (one slot) in Single-Weapon Style and may not put slots into any other style.

- 6th level: Gains the Evasion ability.

EVASION: When a Monk is hit by a spell that can be evaded (Fireball, Lightning Bolt, etc.), the Monk is allowed a Save vs. Breath to completely avoid the effects. If the Saving Throw is failed, the spell works normally, including a save for half damage if the spell allows for it. A helpless Monk (e.g. held, stunned, or asleep) cannot use Evasion.

SUN SOUL MONK: Sun Soul Monks were once worshippers of Amaunator in the time of the Netheril, but today their worship is divided between Lathander, Selune, and Sune. Sun Soul Monks adhere strictly to the law, using their martial arts and magical abilities to drive out darkness and corruption wherever they find it.

Advantages:
- 2nd level: May cast Sun Soulray once per day.

SUN SOULRAY: The character projects a blast of light from <PRO_HISHER> open palm, dealing 1d8 magic fire damage for every 2 caster levels (up to a maximum of 25d8 damage). Undead creatures take an additional 5d8 points of damage. There is no Saving Throw against this ability.

- 5th level: May cast Flaming Fists once per day.

FLAMING FISTS: The character channels <PRO_HISHER> inner light into <PRO_HISHER> unarmed attacks, turning <PRO_HISHER> fists into flaming weapons that deal an additional 2d6 magic fire damage per hit for the next round. The duration increases to 2 rounds at level 9, 3 rounds at level 12, 4 rounds at level 15, and 5 rounds at level 25. This special ability automatically modifies normal attacks; no weapon-switching needs to be done.

- 6th level: Gains an additional use of Sun Soulray.
- 8th level: May cast Greater Sun once per day.

GREATER SUN: The character wreathes <PRO_HIMHER>self in flames similar to a Fireshield (Red), granting the character 50% resistance to fire and magic fire and protecting <PRO_HIMHER> from attacks made within a 5-ft. radius. An opponent that hits the character with any weapons or spells within this radius suffers 1d8+2 points of magic fire damage.

- 10th level: Gains an additional use of Sun Soulray.

Shamans have been overhauled:

SHAMAN: Shamans forge a divine connection with the natural world, similar to the way Druids commune with nature, but Shamans are more spiritual than primal. They directly tap into the energies that flow through the earth and air, through plants and animals, and even through the dead, and shape these energies to obey their will. Nowhere is this more evident than in their ability to summon powerful spirits as guardians and defenders. A being of two worlds, Shamans value balance over dominance.

CLASS FEATURES:

- May only wear leather, studded leather, and hide armor.
- May not equip shields larger than bucklers.
- May only use the following weapons: dagger, club, spear, axe, quarterstaff, dart, sling, and shortbow.
- May only become Proficient (one slot) in any weapon class.
- May only become Proficient (one slot) in any fighting style.
- May cast druidic spells.
- Does not automatically learn all spells of a given level as Druids do. Instead, Shamans select new spells to learn at each level, which they can cast daily without memorization.
- Gains access to a number of Shaman-specific spells, which can be cast like any other: Spirit Ward, Writhing Fog, Spiritual Clarity, Spirit Fire, Recall Spirit, Spiritual Lock, Ether Gate, and Ethereal Retribution.
- Gains use of the Detect Illusion skill with 20% points as a base and an 4 points per level, up to a maximum of 220% at level 50.
- May use Shamanic Dance at will.

SHAMANIC DANCE: Shamans can summon spirit allies by performing a ritualistic dance. While dancing, the Shaman cannot perform any action other than moving. Each round while the Shaman dances, there is a 50% base chance plus 2% for each level of the Shaman that a spirit will answer the call, up to a maximum of 100% at level 25. Any summoned spirits will disappear if the Shaman moves, stops dancing, or if the spirits leave visual range. The spirits grow in power as the Shaman gains additional levels:
  Level 1: Minor animal spirits (snake, fox, hound), up to 2 spirits at the same time.
  Level 6: Major animal spirits (bear, panther, boar), up to 3 spirits at the same time.
  Level 12: Minor nature spirits (lesser air spirit, lesser earth spirit, lesser fire spirit), up to 4 spirits at the same time.
  Level 18: Major nature spirits (air spirit, earth spirit, fire spirit), up to 5 spirits at the same time.
The type of the summoned spirit is randomly determined from all the spirits available at the Shaman's level. For example, a level 12 Shaman will summon either a minor nature spirit, a major animal spirit, or a minor animal spirit, but cannot choose which one appears. Spirits will do their best to protect the Shaman but are not controlled directly.
- 21st level: May cast Spirit Form once per day. Gains an additional use at levels 32 and 43.

SPIRIT FORM: The shaman slips into a space between the spirit world and the material plane, rendering them partially incorporeal. For the next 5 rounds, all physical attacks directed against the shaman deal 50% of their normal damage. During this time, the shaman is also under the effects of Improved Invisibility and cannot be directly targeted by spells.

- 24th level: May cast Favored of the Spirits once per day. Gains an additional use at levels 36 and 48.

FAVORED OF THE SPIRITS: This powerful rite shields the Shaman from death for 1 hour or until discharged. While under the protection of this rite, the Shaman is immune to all forms of death magic. In addition, if the Shaman is reduced below 10% Hit Points and the rite is active, the Shaman instantly receives the benefit of a Heal spell. The rite's protection (including the immunity to death) is completely discharged once the Heal spell is triggered.

- 25th level: The Shaman now always summons the most powerful spirits <PRO_HESHE> can call.
- 30th level: The Shaman can now summon any number of spirits at a time, and the spirits ignore the summoning limit.
- 40th level: The Shaman now summons two spirits each round while dancing.

- Does not gain bonus spells per day from high Wisdom.
- Alignment restricted to neutral good, true neutral, and neutral evil.
- Hit Die: d8




- Turn Undead Synergy

With this component installed, having more than one character turn undead at once increases the level of undead they can turn. This component requires EEex to be installed, and you must start a new game for it to work.


- Allow high-level spellcasters to cast multiple low-level spells per round

This component aims to make low-level spells more useful later on in the game. With this component installed, if a mage, sorcerer, cleric, druid or shaman who is at least level 10 would cast a 1st-level spell, they may immediately start casting another spell without waiting for the round to be over. For every 10 additional caster levels, an additional spell level may be quickened this way: 2nd-level spells at level 20, 3rd-level spells at level 30, 4th-level spells at level 40, and 5th-level spells at level 50.

Both party members and enemies can quicken their spells. You must start a new game for this component to affect your party members.


- Allow druids to cast spells while shapeshifted

This component allows druids to cast spells while shapeshifted.
