# Short description of the mod, main goals, features etc
Description = This is a mod for the game Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition. It will not work on the original version of Icewind Dale. This mod provides a more interesting version of Icewind Dale's Heart of Fury mode. Enemies are powered up greatly, but usually in other ways than just giving them large amounts of hit points. Like in Icewind Dale 2's HoF mode, most items in the game are empowered.
