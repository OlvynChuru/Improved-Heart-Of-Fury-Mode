@501=~BERSERKER: This is a warrior who is in tune with <PRO_HISHER> animalistic side and, during combat, can achieve an ecstatic state of mind that will enable <PRO_HIMHER> to fight longer, harder, and more savagely than any person has a right to. Berserkers tend to be barbarian-like in nature, but not always. Sometimes it is a conscious choice that a warrior in training makes.

The opposite is true of evil Clerics as well, and there are also many variations in between.

@520=~PRIEST OF TEMPUS: Tempus, also known as the Lord of Battles or the Foehammer, is random in his favors, yet his chaotic nature favors all sides equally.

Disadvantages:
- Alignment restricted to chaotic good, chaotic neutral, chaotic evil, or true neutral.~

Advantages:
- May use the Summon Spirit Animal ability once per day. Gains one use at level 1 and an additional use every 5 levels thereafter.

SUMMON SPIRIT ANIMAL: The Totemic Druid summons a special spirit animal (spirit bear, spirit wolf, spirit lion, or spirit snake) to aid <PRO_HIMHER> for 6 turns.

Disadvantages:
- Cannot use shapeshift.~
@523=~SHAPESHIFTER: This Druid is not called Shapeshifter because <PRO_HESHE> has access to a great variety of forms, but rather because of <PRO_HISHER> complete dedication to a single alternate form. This Druid has willingly allowed <PRO_HIMHER>self to become infected with lycanthropy, but due to intense study and training <PRO_HESHE> has the ability to control <PRO_HISHER> affliction.

@525=~MAGE: The wizard strives to be a master of magical energies, shaping them and casting them as spells. To do so, <PRO_HESHE> studies strange tongues and obscure facts and devotes much of <PRO_HISHER> time to magical research. A wizard must rely on knowledge and wit to survive. Wizards are rarely seen adventuring without a retinue of fighters and men-at-arms. Because there are different types (or schools) of magic, there are different types of wizards. The Mage studies all types of magic and learns a wide variety of spells; <PRO_HISHER> broad range makes <PRO_HIMHER> well suited to the demands of adventuring.

CLASS FEATURES:

With it and <PRO_HISHER> wits, <PRO_HESHE> makes <PRO_HISHER> way through the world. A Bard is a talented musician and a walking storehouse of gossip, tall tales, and lore; <PRO_HESHE> learns a little bit about everything that crosses <PRO_HISHER> path and is a jack-of-all-trades but master of none.

@536=~SORCERER: Sorcerers are practitioners of magic who were born with the innate ability to cast spells. It is thought that the blood of some powerful creature flows through their veins; perhaps they are the spawn of the gods themselves, or even dragons walking in humanoid form. Regardless, the Sorcerer's magic is intuitive rather than logical. They know fewer spells than Mages, and acquire spells more slowly, but they can cast spells more often and have no need to select and prepare spells ahead of time.

- Gains use of the Detect Illusion skill with 20% points as a base and an 4 points per level, up to a maximum of 220% at level 50.
- May use Shamanic Dance at will.

SHAMANIC DANCE: Shamans can summon spirit allies by performing a ritualistic dance. While dancing, the Shaman cannot perform any action other than moving. Each round while the Shaman dances, there is a 50% base chance plus 2% for each level of the Shaman that a spirit will answer the call, up to a maximum of 100% at level 25. Any summoned spirits will disappear if the Shaman moves, stops dancing, or if the spirits leave visual range. The spirits grow in power as the Shaman gains additional levels:
  Level 1: Minor animal spirits (snake, fox, hound), up to 2 spirits at the same time.
  Level 6: Major animal spirits (bear, panther, boar), up to 3 spirits at the same time.
  Level 12: Minor nature spirits (lesser air spirit, lesser earth spirit, lesser fire spirit), up to 4 spirits at the same time.
  Level 18: Major nature spirits (air spirit, earth spirit, fire spirit), up to 5 spirits at the same time.
The type of the summoned spirit is randomly determined from all the spirits available at the Shaman's level. For example, a level 12 Shaman will summon either a minor nature spirit, a major animal spirit, or a minor animal spirit, but cannot choose which one appears. Spirits will do their best to protect the Shaman but are not controlled directly.
- 21st level: May cast Spirit Form once per day. Gains an additional use at levels 32 and 43.

SPIRIT FORM: The shaman slips into a space between the spirit world and the material plane, rendering them partially incorporeal. For the next 5 rounds, all physical attacks directed against the shaman deal 50% of their normal damage. During this time, the shaman is also under the effects of Improved Invisibility and cannot be directly targeted by spells.

- 24th level: May cast Favored of the Spirits once per day. Gains an additional use at levels 36 and 48.

FAVORED OF THE SPIRITS: This powerful rite shields the Shaman from death for 1 hour or until discharged. While under the protection of this rite, the Shaman is immune to all forms of death magic. In addition, if the Shaman is reduced below 10% Hit Points and the rite is active, the Shaman instantly receives the benefit of a Heal spell. The rite's protection (including the immunity to death) is completely discharged once the Heal spell is triggered.

- 25th level: The Shaman now always summons the most powerful spirits <PRO_HESHE> can call.
- 30th level: The Shaman can now summon any number of spirits at a time, and the spirits ignore the summoning limit.
- 40th level: The Shaman now summons two spirits each round while dancing.

- Does not gain bonus spells per day from high Wisdom.
- Alignment restricted to neutral good, true neutral, and neutral evil.
- Hit Die: d8~

This shield not only grants the user 90% Fire Resistance and an AC bonus of 4, but also protects <PRO_HIMHER> from attacks made within a 5-ft. radius. An opponent that hits the caster with any weapons or spells within this radius suffers 2d10+2 fire damage. In addition, the intense heat protects the caster from all non-magical weapons, melee or missile.~
@20734=~Destruction
(Necromancy)

Level: 7
Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: Special

This spell instantly destroys a target, blasting it into small chunks. The victim is allowed a Save vs. Death at a penalty of -4; if successful, the target takes 8d6 points of magic damage instead of being destroyed. Destruction can only be cast by evil characters. Unlike the 5th-level spell Slay Living, Destruction destroys the target with divine force rather than with negative energy. As a result, it can destroy undead, constructs, and extraplanar creatures.~
@20736=~Mist of Eldath
(Invocation)

Level: 7
Sphere: Elemental
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 9

@20739=~Energy Drain
(Necromancy)

Level: 7
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Casting this spell opens a channel between the caster's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. The caster acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life from a victim and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane, draining <PRO_HIMHER> of 1 level of experience per 3 caster levels (max 16 levels drained by a level 48 caster). The target of this spell loses levels, Hit Dice, Hit Points, and abilities permanently. These levels can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell. This spell has no effect on undead, constructs, or extraplanar creatures. It can only be cast by evil-aligned characters.~
@20740=~Wither
(Necromancy)

Level: 7
Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 round/2 levels
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This powerful spell causes the organs of the touched creature to cease functioning and wither away. The creature affected will lose 3 Hit Points per second. The effect lasts for 1 round per 2 levels of the caster or until dispelled. For example, a 14th-level priest would cause the targeted creature to lose 18 Hit Points per round for 7 rounds. This spell has no effect on undead, constructs, or extraplanar creatures. It can only be cast by evil-aligned characters.~
@20751=~Ethereal Retribution
(Conjuration)

Level: 7
Sphere: Summoning
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: 10 rounds
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius 
Saving Throw: Special

Ghostly figures called by the Shaman swirl around the battlefield, tormenting the Shaman's adversaries. All enemies within the area of effect take 3d8 points of magic damage per round for the next 10 rounds (no save). In addition, all living enemies (undead and constructs are unaffected) must save vs. Spell at -3 every round or lose 2 points of Strength for 15 rounds. The Strength loss is cumulative, and a creature reduced to 0 Strength dies instantly.~
@21102=~Armor
(Conjuration)

Level: 1
Range: Touch
Duration: 9 hours
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the wizard creates a magical field of force that serves as if it were plate mail armor (AC 3). It is cumulative with Dexterity and, in the case of Fighter/Mages, with the shield bonus. The Armor spell does not hinder movement, adds no weight or encumbrance, and does not prevent spellcasting. It lasts until successfully dispelled or until the duration runs out.~
@21111=~True Strike
(Divination)

Level: 1
Range: 0
Duration: 9 seconds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Through magical intuition, the wizard gains a +20 bonus to THAC0, giving <HIMHER> nearly perfect accuracy with weapon attacks. Unfortunately, the effect only lasts for 9 seconds.~
@21116=~Sleep
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Sleep causes a comatose slumber to come upon enemies within 15 feet of the target point. Monsters with 7 or more Hit Dice are unaffected, but any number of enemies with 6 Hit Dice or less can be put to sleep, regardless of their total Hit Dice. There is no Saving Throw. Though it's not the stuff of which legends are made, attacks against magically sleeping opponents never miss-although they will awaken after the first hit.~
@21117=~Chill Touch
(Necromancy)

Level: 1
Range: Touch
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

When the caster completes this spell, a blue glow encompasses <PRO_HISHER> hand, and <PRO_HESHE> uses this energy to attack the life force of an adjacent creature. No attack roll is needed. The touched creature takes 5d4 magic cold damage and must Save vs. Death or lose 3 points of Strength for 5 rounds. The Strength loss is cumulative; if the creature is reduced to 0 Strength, it dies instantly.

An undead creature suffers no damage or Strength loss from Chill Touch, but will be affected by panic for 2 turns unless it successfully makes a Save vs. Spell.~
@21119=~Larloch's Minor Drain
(Necromancy)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the wizard drains the life force from a target and adds it to <PRO_HISHER> own. The target creature suffers 12 magic damage, while the wizard gains 12 Hit Points. If the wizard goes over <PRO_HISHER> maximum Hit Point total with this spell, <PRO_HESHE> loses them after 1 hour. This spell has no effect on constructs or undead.~
@21123=~Find Familiar
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 1
Range: n/a
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 familiar
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to attempt to summon a familiar to act as <PRO_HISHER> aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit a wizard, conveying its sensory powers to its master, conversing with <PRO_HIMHER>, and serving as a guard/scout/spy as well. A wizard can have only one familiar at a time, and <PRO_HESHE> has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any come at all.

(Note: This spell may only be cast by the protagonist.)

The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically by 2 or 3 Intelligence points), and its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life. The wizard has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands. The caster receives half the familiar's total Hit Points (rounded down) as bonus Hit Points. However, the caster must take care to treat <PRO_HISHER> familiar well, for if the familiar should die, the caster loses the bonus Hit Points and half the familiar's Hit Points again as damage. Also when a familiar dies, the caster loses 1 point of Constitution PERMANENTLY.

Example: A Mage has 24 Hit Points and casts Find Familiar. The imp summoned has 36 Hit Points, so the caster gets a bonus of 18 Hit Points. The caster now has 42 Hit Points. If the familiar dies, the caster loses those 18 Hit Points (putting <PRO_HIMHER> back at 24), loses 1 point of Constitution permanently (which may cause additional Hit Point loss), and takes 18 damage.

Here is a list of the familiars that the player receives according to alignment:

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Expeditious Retreat can only be cast on an ally. The spell quadruples the target's normal speed for a short period of time... usually long enough to escape.

While Expeditious Retreat is active, the target cannot attack, cast spells, or use any items or special abilities... <PRO_HESHE> can only run.

Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

Saving Throw: 1/2

Upon casting this spell, a skull is thrown by the caster at the target area. The skull floats in the area until a creature comes within 8 ft. of it. When this happens, the skull is triggered and explodes, damaging everyone within an 12-ft. radius. The magic damage inflicted is equal to 1d6 Hit Points per level of the caster (save vs. Breath for half), up to a maximum of 10d6.

An opponent that damages the caster within this radius suffers 1d8+2 cold damage.~

@21406=~Minor Globe Of Invulnerability
(Abjuration)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that prevents any 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell effects from penetrating (i.e. the area of effect of any such spell does not include the area of the Minor Globe Of Invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere with no penalty. The globe can be brought down by a successful Dispel Magic spell.~
@21409=~Contagion
(Necromancy)

Level: 4
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell causes a major disease and weakness in a creature if it fails a Save vs. Polymorph at -5. The afflicted individual is immediately stricken with painful and distracting symptoms: boils, blotches, lesions, seeping abscesses, and so on. Strength, Dexterity, and Charisma scores are reduced by 2. The afflicted character is also slowed. These effects persist until the character receives a Cure Disease spell.~
@21411=~Emotion, Hopelessness
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 15 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 7-ft. radius

@21412=~Greater Malison
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 4

(Alteration)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 7 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell encloses the target in a globe of shimmering force for the duration of the spell. The resilient sphere is completely immune to all damage; the only method of removing the sphere is by the use of Dispel Magic. Hence, the creature caught inside the globe is completely safe from all attacks, but at the same time is completely unable to affect the outside world. Hostile creatures can resist the effect with Magic Resistance, but there is no Saving Throw.~
@21414=~Spirit Armor
(Necromancy)

Level: 4
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell is very similar to the 3rd-level spell Ghost Armor in that it creates an incorporeal barrier around the target's body for the duration of the spell. This spell, however, actually taps in to the target's life force in order to create the barrier. The armor itself is weightless and does not hinder movement or spellcasting at all.

Spirit Armor does not work cumulatively with any other armor; however, Dexterity bonuses still apply, as well as magic rings and shield bonuses. While in effect, the Armor Class of the recipient will be 0, as if <PRO_HESHE> were wearing full plate +1. Also, due to the magical nature of the spell, <PRO_HESHE> will also receive a +3 bonus to saves vs. Spell.

There is a danger, however, as when the spell runs out, the external portion of the spirit is temporarily lost, inflicting 2d4 points of magic damage upon the target.~
@21417=~Enchanted Weapon
(Enchantment)

Level: 4
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature

(Evocation, Alteration)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

The red fireshield protects the user from fire damage by surrounding the caster with a shield of flame. This shield does not only grant the user +50% Fire Resistance and +25% Magic Fire Resistances, it also protects <PRO_HIMHER> from attacks made from within a 5-ft. radius around <PRO_HIMHER>. An opponent that damages the caster within this radius suffers 1d8+2 points of fire damage.~
@21422=~Beltyn's Burning Blood
(Necromancy)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/2 levels
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell turns a target's blood to flame, doing 3d4 Hit Points of damage every round and driving the victim berserk with pain. The target gets to save vs. Spell at -4 every round; if successful, the damage and berserk state are negated. This spell does not work against undead or extraplanar creatures that do not have blood (such as elementals). If the creature is resistant to fire, this resistance will lower or nullify the damage from this spell.~

(Divination)

Level: 4
Range: Special
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: Instant
Area of Effect: Special

Farsight has no casting time, can be cast immediately after another spell, and can be cast while the game is paused.~
@21425=~Wizard Eye
(Divination, Alteration)

Level: 4
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is employed, the wizard creates an invisible sensory organ that sends <PRO_HIMHER> visual information. The wizard eye can see with normal vision up to standard visual range and can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. It has substance and a form that can be detected (by a Detect Invisibility spell, for instance). Solid barriers prevent the passage of a wizard eye. The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. A successful Dispel Magic spell cast on the wizard or the eye ends the spell.~

(Invocation)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 17-ft. cone with 15-deg. arc
Saving Throw: Special

Shout grants the wizard tremendous vocal powers, allowing <PRO_HIMHER> to emit an earsplitting roar from <PRO_HISHER> mouth in a cone-shaped area of effect. Any creature within this area is deafened for 9 rounds and suffers 10d6 points of magic damage. A successful Save vs. Spell negates the deafness and reduces the damage by half. The targets are also knocked back, whether they make the save or not.~
@21503=~Cone of Cold
(Evocation)

Level: 5
Range: 0

Level: 5
Range: 100
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 1

Saving Throw: None

A combination of Dimension Door and Improved Invisibility, Shadow Door creates a door, which the caster steps through. The caster is then teleported to a point of <PRO_HISHER> choice within 100 feet. When <PRO_HESHE> arrives at that spot, <PRO_HESHE> is invisible (as per the Improved Invisibility spell), for the spell's duration. A True Seeing spell, a gem of seeing, or similar magical means can reveal the wizard.~
@21507=~Hold Monster
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell holds 1d4 enemies of any type (except for undead) rigidly immobile. Specifically, it affects the targeted enemy and up to 3 hostile creatures within 10 ft. of it. A successful Save vs. Spell at -2 negates the effect.

Paralyzed creatures are helpless and cannot dodge or defend themselves from attacks. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subject's condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~
@21510=~Spell Immunity
(Abjuration)

Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Casting this spell grants the wizard protection from one spell school of <PRO_HISHER> choice. After the spell is cast, the wizard must choose the school <PRO_HESHE> wishes to be protected from. All spells of this school will not be able to harm or aid the caster for the duration of this spell. Spell Immunity cannot grant protection from Abjuration spells, as it would be paradoxical for Spell Immunity to prevent itself from applying.~

Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 120-ft. radius

The spells affected are Blur, Reflected Image, Invisibility, Mirror Image, Non-Detection, Improved Invisibility, Shadow Door, Pixie Dust, Mislead, Project Image, and Simulacrum. The caster can control whom this spell affects; thus, it will affect only creatures that are not in the caster's party. A target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.~
@21518=~Phantom Blade
(Evocation)

Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a translucent, shadow-like, weightless area of magical force extending from the fingers of one of the caster's hands. The silent, blade-shaped construct's cutting edges inflict slashing damage just as those of a real sword do. The phantom blade uses the long sword proficiency, but it grants the wielder proficiency in long swords if <PRO_HESHE> has none.

The phantom blade acts as a +3 magical sword and deals 1d10+3 damage, but it also has +20 to hit, since it ignores all defenses. Due to its etheric nature, it causes an extra +10 magic damage against undead creatures. This sword can only be used by the caster and remains in <PRO_HISHER> hand for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~
@21519=~Spell Shield
(Abjuration)

Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: 8 rounds
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell forms a shield around the caster that protects <PRO_HIMHER> from dispelling effects. Dispel Magic, Remove Magic, and similar spells will have no effect on <PRO_HIMHER>. The shield is still vulnerable to spells that remove spell protections, such as Spell Thrust, Secret Word, Pierce Magic, Ruby Ray, Khelben's Warding Whip, Pierce Shield, and Spellstrike. If one of these spells is cast at the wizard, the shield dissipates. Otherwise, it will last for its duration.~

Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/2 levels (special)
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 5-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes a creature to burst into flames. The creature will burn for 2d6 points of fire damage every round, and gouts of flame erupt from the burning target, causing any creatures within 5 ft. to take 2d6 points of fire damage from the flames. Shroud of Flame can be cast even on a creature that is immune to fire; the creature will not be harmed, but they will still radiate flames outward, damaging nearby creatures.~

(Abjuration)

Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster

@21611=~Protection From Magical Weapons
(Abjuration)

Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When the spell is cast, it confers complete invulnerability to all magical weapons. This spell cannot be cast on anyone who is protected from normal weapons or anyone who is protected by Mantle, Improved Mantle, or Absolute Immunity. Due to the short casting time and duration, this spell is mainly used to buy the wizard a few rounds in the thick of combat. This effect lasts for 3 rounds or until dispelled.~

Level: 6
Range: Visual range of the caster

Level: 6
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 15 rounds
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 12-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell brings forth a billowing cloud of acidic fog. The thick fog limits movement to 50% of a creature's current movement rate. Exposure to the fog deals 4 acid damage per round, but it also gives a cumulative 50% vulnerability to acid for 11 seconds (after it deals the damage). 

While in the fog, creatures must save vs. Spell every round or suffer -2 to Strength and Dexterity for the duration of that round.~
@21615=~Chain Lightning
(Evocation)

Level: 6
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell releases a burst of electrical energy at a target; unlike the Lightning Bolt spell, however, once the bolt strikes the initial target, the electricity then jumps to the next nearest foe, losing a small amount of energy with each additional strike until it is expended. The bolt initially inflicts 1d6 Hit Points of electrical damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 20d6 points of damage. Each jump the bolt makes reduces the damage by 1d6. Each creature that is hit is allowed a Save vs. Spell for half damage.~

The wizard gains immunity to paralysis and fear while the spell is in effect, and <PRO_HISHER> hands glow with an unearthly blue radiance. When the wizard attacks a creature with the lich's touch, that creature takes 1d2 fist damage (plus Strength bonus) and 3d10 magic cold damage, and the creature must Save vs. Paralysis at -2 or be paralyzed for 3 rounds.

Range: 0
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 5

Saving Throw: None

This spell creates nine darts that can be used by the caster and cannot be unequipped so long as the spell is in effect. The darts are +3, do 1d4+3 missile damage with +3 to hit, and a creature struck by a dart must Save vs. Death at -6 or take 2d6 magic damage and have its Strength reduced by 3 for 5 rounds. Strength reduction is cumulative, and hitting a single creature with multiple darts can potentially reduce its Strength to 0, killing it instantly. Undead, constructs and extraplanar creatures are immune to the magic damage and Strength reduction from these darts. The caster gains proficiency in darts as long as <PRO_HESHE> has at least one dart remaining, unless <PRO_HESHE> already has a higher level of proficiency in darts.~

Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

The caster utters the Finger of Death incantation, points <PRO_HISHER> index finger at the creature to be slain, and unless the victim makes a Save vs. Death at -2, the victim dies instantly. Even if the save is successful, however, the brush with death still inflicts 2d8+30 points of magic damage. Characters slain by Finger of Death cannot be resurrected—they are gone forever.~

Eye of the Mind: This orb protects the caster against mental attacks such as charm, emotion, and fear. The eye can be expended as the 5th-level wizard spell Domination, bringing a creature under the caster's control for 15 rounds (Save vs. Spell at -2 negates).

Eye of the Sword: This eye deflects the first physical damaging attack that strikes the caster. The eye may be expended as the 4th-level wizard spell Mordenkainen's Force Missiles, creating up to 7 missiles that strike the target.

Eye of the Mage: This eye absorbs one manifestation of fire, electrical, cold, or acid damage. The eye can also be expended as the 6th-level wizard spell Chain Lightning, dealing 1d6 electrical damage per level (capped at 20d6) to the first target and bouncing to other creatures for less damage.

Eye of Fortitude: This eye blocks one stunning, deafness, blindness, or silence effect. It may alternatively be expended as the 4th-level wizard spell Shout, dealing 10d6 magic damage and deafening and knocking back creatures within a 35-ft. cone (Save vs. Spell halves damage and negates deafness).

A successful Save vs. Breath at -4 negates all effects but 2d8 points of damage for one round.

Spells that affect respiration or the physiology of the caster, such as Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting, Flaying, or Drown, are ignored. In addition, the caster's Strength is raised to 25.

Unfortunately, the caster's movement becomes slow and awkward, setting <PRO_HISHER> movement rate to 25% of <PRO_HISHER> normal.~

(Abjuration, Alteration)

Level: 9
Range: 80 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This includes Minor Spell Turning, Minor Globe Of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Globe Of Invulnerability, Minor Spell Deflection, Spell Turning, Spell Shield, Spell Deflection, and Spell Trap. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.

@21907=~Absolute Immunity
(Abjuration)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When the spell is cast, it confers complete invulnerability to all weapons except for those of greater than +5 enchantment. This spell is incredibly powerful, hence the short duration. However, the casting time is also very short, making this spell incredibly useful in the thick of combat, where buying a few seconds can mean the difference between life or death. It is important to note that this spell does not work in combination with Protection From Magical Weapons. This spell lasts for the duration or until dispelled.~
@21911=~Meteor Swarm
(Evocation)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 15
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

When the caster utters the words to this powerful spell, <PRO_HESHE> calls upon mighty forces indeed. These forces pull down meteors from above, hurling them randomly at anyone in the area of effect, which is centered on the caster. Every second, any creature in the area of effect has a 50% chance to be struck by a meteor, taking 1d12 crushing damage and 1d12 fire damage with no save. The caster is protected from the meteors, but <PRO_HISHER> allies are not. The caster is well advised to be careful in <PRO_HISHER> use of this spell.~

(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 9
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1

(Necromancy)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

At the culmination of this dreadful spell, the wizard screams like a banshee (groaning spirit). Everyone in the area of effect hears the awful cry. Those who fail a Save vs. Death at -2 die instantly. The caster and companions are immune to the effects of the wail.~
@21914=~Energy Drain
(Necromancy)

Level: 9
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Casting this spell opens a channel between the caster's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. The caster acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life from a victim and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane, draining <PRO_HIMHER> of 1 level of experience per 3 caster levels (max 16 levels drained by a level 48 caster). The target of this spell loses levels, Hit Dice, Hit Points, and abilities permanently. These levels can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell. This spell has no effect on undead, constructs, or extraplanar creatures.~

(Evocation)

Level: 9
Range: 35 ft.
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a huge, disembodied fist that crushes the target and attempts to pin <PRO_HIMHER> to the ground. In the first round, the spell does 8d10 crushing damage, and the victim is pinned down for 1 round. In the second round, the victim must save vs. Paralysis at -4 or suffer 7d10 damage and be pinned down again. In the third and final round, the victim must save vs. Paralysis at -2 or receive 6d10 damage and be pinned down for 2 rounds. The hand then disappears.~

(Any School)

Range: 0
Duration: 2 rounds
Casting Time: 9
