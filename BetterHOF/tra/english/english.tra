Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell summons forth a silent, weightless sword-like construct made of moonlight that extends four feet from the caster's hand. The moonblade is considered a +4 weapon for determining what creatures it can hit, though the bonus does not apply to attack rolls made with it. In addition, due to the insubstantial nature of the moonblade, damage bonuses from Strength do not apply, though to hit bonuses do. The moonblade uses the scimitar proficiency, but it gives the wielder proficiency in scimitars unless <PRO_HESHE> already has it.

The strike of a moonblade drains a target's vitality, inflicting 1d12+4 points of magic damage, plus an additional 2d12 points to undead, who are particularly susceptible. A successful strike also temporarily scrambles magic, causing any spells the target casts in the next round to fail.~

In addition, the target's movement rate is doubled and <PRO_HESHE> gains +5 to hit, +7 to damage, and +5 to Strength. The spell has several disadvantages, however: The Hit Points of the target are masked for the duration of the spell, and the target cannot benefit from any effect that heals Hit Points. At the end of the spell's duration, the target becomes fatigued and <PRO_HISHER> Strength drops to 3 for 1 turn. Blood Rage cannot affectâ€”and cannot be cast byâ€”creatures of lawful alignment.~

It is treated as a magical weapon, doing 1d6+2 Hit Points of damage per hit with a +2 bonus to hit, and it can hit creatures that require +2 weapons to hit.

The staff also has the power to drain a target of 5 Hit Points on every strike. These Hit Points are added to the caster's, but they can only heal damage the caster has taken; they will not raise <PRO_HISHER> Hit Points beyond <PRO_HISHER> normal maximum.~

This spell encloses the target in a globe of shimmering force for the duration of the spell. The resilient sphere is completely immune to all damage; the only method of removing the sphere is by the use of Dispel Magic. Hence, the creature caught inside the globe is completely safe from all attacks, but at the same time is completely unable to affect the outside world. Hostile creatures can resist the effect with Magic Resistance, but there is no Saving Throw.~
@21414=~Spirit Armor
(Necromancy)

Level: 4
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell is very similar to the 3rd-level spell Ghost Armor in that it creates an incorporeal barrier around the target's body for the duration of the spell. This spell, however, actually taps in to the target's life force in order to create the barrier. The armor itself is weightless and does not hinder movement or spellcasting at all.

Spirit Armor does not work cumulatively with any other armor; however, Dexterity bonuses still apply, as well as magic rings and shield bonuses. While in effect, the Armor Class of the recipient will be 0, as if <PRO_HESHE> were wearing full plate +1. Also, due to the magical nature of the spell, <PRO_HESHE> will also receive a +3 bonus to saves vs. Spell.

There is a danger, however, as when the spell runs out, the external portion of the spirit is temporarily lost, inflicting 2d4 points of magic damage upon the target.~
@21417=~Enchanted Weapon
(Enchantment)

Level: 4
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature

Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/2 levels
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell turns a target's blood to flame, doing 3d4 Hit Points of damage every round and driving the victim berserk with pain. The target gets to save vs. Spell at -4 every round; if successful, the damage and berserk state are negated. This spell does not work against undead or extraplanar creatures that do not have blood (such as elementals). If the creature is resistant to fire, this resistance will lower or nullify the damage from this spell.~
@21424=~Farsight
(Divination)

Level: 4
Range: Special
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: Instant
Area of Effect: Special

(Invocation)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 17-ft. cone with 15-deg. arc
Saving Throw: Special

Shout grants the wizard tremendous vocal powers, allowing <PRO_HIMHER> to emit an earsplitting roar from <PRO_HISHER> mouth in a cone-shaped area of effect. Any creature within this area is deafened for 9 rounds and suffers 10d6 points of magic damage. A successful Save vs. Spell negates the deafness and reduces the damage by half. The targets are also knocked back, whether they make the save or not.~
@21505=~Shadow Door
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 5
Range: 100
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

A combination of Dimension Door and Improved Invisibility, Shadow Door creates a door, which the caster steps through. The caster is then teleported to a point of <PRO_HISHER> choice within 100 feet. When <PRO_HESHE> arrives at that spot, <PRO_HESHE> is invisible (as per the Improved Invisibility spell), for the spell's duration. A True Seeing spell, a gem of seeing, or similar magical means can reveal the wizard.~
@21507=~Hold Monster
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell holds 1d4 enemies of any type (except for undead) rigidly immobile. Specifically, it affects the targeted enemy and up to 3 hostile creatures within 10 ft. of it. A successful Save vs. Spell at -2 negates the effect.

Paralyzed creatures are helpless and cannot dodge or defend themselves from attacks. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subject's condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~
@21515=~Oracle
(Divination)

Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 120-ft. radius

The spells affected are Blur, Reflected Image, Invisibility, Mirror Image, Non-Detection, Improved Invisibility, Shadow Door, Pixie Dust, Mislead, Project Image, and Simulacrum. The caster can control whom this spell affects; thus, it will affect only creatures that are not in the caster's party. A target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.~
@21518=~Phantom Blade
(Evocation)

Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a translucent, shadow-like, weightless area of magical force extending from the fingers of one of the caster's hands. The silent, blade-shaped construct's cutting edges inflict slashing damage just as those of a real sword do. The phantom blade uses the long sword proficiency, but it grants the wielder proficiency in long swords if <PRO_HESHE> has none.

The phantom blade acts as a +3 magical sword and deals 1d10+3 damage, but it also has +20 to hit, since it ignores all defenses. Due to its etheric nature, it causes an extra +10 magic damage against undead creatures. This sword can only be used by the caster and remains in <PRO_HISHER> hand for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~
@21519=~Spell Shield
(Abjuration)

Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: 8 rounds
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell forms a shield around the caster that protects <PRO_HIMHER> from dispelling effects. Dispel Magic, Remove Magic, and similar spells will have no effect on <PRO_HIMHER>. The shield is still vulnerable to spells that remove spell protections, such as Spell Thrust, Secret Word, Pierce Magic, Ruby Ray, Khelben's Warding Whip, Pierce Shield, and Spellstrike. If one of these spells is cast at the wizard, the shield dissipates. Otherwise, it will last for its duration.~
@21524=~Shroud of Flame
(Invocation)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/2 levels (special)
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 5-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes a creature to burst into flames. The creature will burn for 2d6 points of fire damage every round, and gouts of flame erupt from the burning target, causing any creatures within 5 ft. to take 1d4 points of fire damage from the flames. Anyone hit by the victim's flames will contract the shroud themselves. The shroud of flame dissipates if the caster and target are no longer in the same area. This spell is particularly useful in dispersing packs of trolls and frost salamanders.~

(Alteration)

Level: 6
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature

Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 6

(Alteration, Evocation)

Level: 6
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 15 rounds
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 12-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell brings forth a billowing cloud of acidic fog. The thick fog limits movement to 50% of a creature's current movement rate. Exposure to the fog deals 4 acid damage per round, but it also gives a cumulative 50% vulnerability to acid for 11 seconds (after it deals the damage). 

While in the fog, creatures must save vs. Spell every round or suffer -2 to Strength and Dexterity for the duration of that round.~
@21615=~Chain Lightning
(Evocation)

Level: 6
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell releases a burst of electrical energy at a target; unlike the Lightning Bolt spell, however, once the bolt strikes the initial target, the electricity then jumps to the next nearest foe, losing a small amount of energy with each additional strike until it is expended. The bolt initially inflicts 1d6 Hit Points of electrical damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 20d6 points of damage. Each jump the bolt makes reduces the damage by 1d6. Each creature that is hit is allowed a Save vs. Spell for half damage.~

Level: 6
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: Special

This spell confers the powers of a lich's touch and a lich's immunities upon the caster. The wizard gains immunity to paralysis and fear while the spell is in effect, and <PRO_HISHER> hands glow with an unearthly blue radiance. When the wizard attacks a creature with the lich's touch, that creature takes 1d2 fist damage (plus Strength bonus) and 3d10 magic cold damage, and the creature must Save vs. Paralysis at -2 or be paralyzed for 3 rounds. Undead and constructs only take the fist damage and are not paralyzed. The lich's touch can affect creatures that require +6 weapons in order to hit.~

(Necromancy)

Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates nine darts that can be used by the caster and cannot be unequipped so long as the spell is in effect. The darts are +3, do 1d4+3 missile damage with +3 to hit, and a creature struck by a dart must Save vs. Death at -6 or take 2d6 magic damage and have its Strength reduced by 3 for 5 rounds. Strength reduction is cumulative, and hitting a single creature with multiple darts can potentially reduce its Strength to 0, killing it instantly. Undead, constructs and extraplanar creatures are immune to the magic damage and Strength reduction from these darts. The caster gains proficiency in darts as long as <PRO_HESHE> has at least one dart remaining, unless <PRO_HESHE> already has a higher level of proficiency in darts.~

The caster utters the Finger of Death incantation, points <PRO_HISHER> index finger at the creature to be slain, and unless the victim makes a Save vs. Death at -2, the victim dies instantly. Even if the save is successful, however, the brush with death still inflicts 2d8+1 points of magic damage. Characters slain by Finger of Death cannot be resurrectedâ€”they are gone forever.~

Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 23-ft. cone with 90-deg. arc
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes shimmering rays of light to flash from the wizard's hand in a 23-ft. cone. Any creature touched by the rays may be inflicted with a random effect depending on the color (see below), but any creature with fewer than 8 Hit Dice is blinded for 5 rounds regardless of any additional effect. The colors of the prismatic spray do the following:

â€“ Red: 20 magic damage (save vs. Spell at -2 for half)
â€“ Orange: 40 magic damage (save vs. Spell at -2 for half)
â€“ Yellow: 80 magic damage (save vs. Spell at -2 for half)

Eye of the Mind: This orb protects the caster against mental attacks such as charm, emotion, and fear. The eye can be expended as the 5th-level wizard spell Domination, bringing a creature under the caster's control for 15 rounds (Save vs. Spell at -2 negates).

Eye of the Sword: This eye deflects the first physical damaging attack that strikes the caster. The eye may be expended as the 4th-level wizard spell Mordenkainen's Force Missiles, creating up to 7 missiles that strike the target.

Eye of the Mage: This eye absorbs one manifestation of fire, electrical, cold, or acid damage. The eye can also be expended as the 6th-level wizard spell Chain Lightning, dealing 1d6 electrical damage per level (capped at 20d6) to the first target and bouncing to other creatures for less damage.

Eye of Venom: This eye halts any one attack or effect that could poison the caster. The eye can also be expended as the 5th-level wizard spell Cloudkill.

Eye of the Spirit: This eye blocks one instant-death magic attack (Death Spell; Finger of Death; Power Word, Kill; Slay Living; Destruction). The wizard may instead choose to expend the eye's power as the 5th-level priest spell Slay Living, instantly killing the target (Save vs. Death negates).

Eye of Fortitude: This eye blocks one stunning, deafness, blindness, or silence effect. It may alternatively be expended as the 4th-level wizard spell Shout, dealing 10d6 magic damage and deafening and knocking back creatures within a 35-ft. cone (Save vs. Spell halves damage and negates deafness).

Eye of Stone: This eye shields the caster from a single petrification attack. It can also be used as the 6th-level wizard spell Flesh to Stone, petrifying the target (Save vs. Petrification negates).~

Saving Throw: 1/2

Upon uttering the Great Shout, the caster releases a stunning force from <PRO_HISHER> mouth in a 30-ft. cone. The Great Shout is extremely taxing and dangerous to the user, who must Save vs. Spell or fall unconscious for 3 rounds. Creatures 15 Hit Dice and under caught within the Great Shout instantly die.

Spells that affect respiration or the physiology of the caster, such as Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting, Flaying, or Drown, are ignored. In addition, the caster's Strength is raised to 25.

Unfortunately, the caster's movement becomes slow and awkward, setting <PRO_HISHER> movement rate to 25% of <PRO_HISHER> normal.~
