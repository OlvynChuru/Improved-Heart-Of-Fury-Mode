The blade was lost when Kalamnin was killed in battle by dozens of nycadaemons. The sorcerer who summoned the creatures, Ylmandi, kept the blade in his family until the fall of Netheril.

When he arrived in Baldur's Gate, he hired himself out as a mercenary, thug, and caravan guard, quickly earning a reputation as an incredibly unreasonable and hot-tempered man. Within his first six months in Baldur's Gate, he had been arrested five times and was known to have almost killed at least four different people who accidentally looked him in the eye for a moment too long. Somehow, however, Bael attracted a small following of easily impressionable thugs who joined him on his seedy adventures. Eventually, Bael managed to scrape together enough money to pay a wizard to craft a powerful sword for him. The Blade of Bael aided its owner well until the mean-spirited brute decided to rough up and harass a young priestess of Eldath. When local Tempurans heard what Bael had done, they descended on him in the street and beat him with clubs, then threw him into the bay. They took his sword to their temple and later auctioned it off to a worthy owner.

Within five years, there were raiders in the area, and farms were being destroyed all around Jonan's. Eventually, the raiders targeted Jonan's home, killing his wife and child and leaving him for dead. His farm was burned to the ground. Weeks later, Jonan crafted this bow and rubbed the ashes of his farm and family into the grain of the wood. He later went on a murderous rampage, slaying each of the bandits where he found them, and later killing anyone they associated with. Sages debate how the bow became enchanted, but most believe that, after Jonan's death, it was blessed by a god. Some say it was blessed by Tyr, some say by Hoar, and others say by Bhaal. Theories tend to revolve around whether the speaker believes Jonan's actions were just, vengeful, or murderous.

When he was a young man, he set off for the city to hire himself out as a mercenary. After a number of successful endeavors, Kheros became a short-term member of many adventuring companies. Along the way, despite his many victories, Kheros became disgusted and terrified by the sight of blood.

His fear eventually spiraled out of control, consuming him with madness. Priests of Tempus found the huge warrior and took him into safekeeping. The priests believed that they could cure Kheros of his fear. Over several years, Kheros learned the ways of the Tempuran religion, eventually becoming a priest. His final step in overcoming his fear was being submerged in a tub of blood until he almost drowned. All the time he was held down, he never struggled, flinched, or tried to escape. In his later years, he had a suit of armor made to remind him of his past.

Stationed atop Shevarash Tower are the magnificent wyverns of the Seldarine's Hand. Along with their riders, these mounts serve primarily as scouts but are sometimes used for missions requiring the utmost of speed.

Both rider and mount are trained rigorously to work as a team. Upon hatching, wyverns are domesticated to be used as mounts. They are trained in what to eat, various combat routines involving aerial and ground attacks, and to respond to the commands of its rider. The rider is educated in the ways of grooming and caring for his or her mount, how to work effectively with it, and also in the ways of aerial and ground combat. As a unit, they have proven excellent aerial support in our ground battles and are a proud symbol of the Seldarine.

The wyvern trainers of the Hand are renowned for their skill in overcoming the wyvern's violent temperament and turning it into a reliable ally. However, if a domesticated wyvern were to be left unattended for even a few weeks, it would surely become feral once more.~

Apparently Prashnak was having a great deal of difficulty fending off a relentless scourge of trolls, who no doubt were interested in nothing more than his dug out, well stationed bower. Prashnak used storms of acid to keep the trolls at bay. However the young mage was tiring of the constant attacks, and the trolls were becoming bolder.

After several months of studying the various effects of wilting magic, elemental summoning, and magical methods of frosting, Prashnak was finally ready to try his experiment. After summoning a water elemental, Prashnak evaporated choice bodily components and then froze the hapless creature. This lead to the creation of truly horrific sculptures of ice. The trolls, as simple as they are, took extreme offense to these totems and reportedly fled the area. The experiment a gleaming success, the exultant Prashnak continues his woeful studies to this day. What manner of thief took hold of the bracers is unknown, but they have been missing for several years.

Legedain was growing old and becoming tired of his frail body. To remedy the situation, he cast Magic Jar and forced Ilfain's spirit into a host gem. Legedain then transferred his soul to the young elf's body and left the gem on a shelf nearby. One hundred years later, Legedain decided to do something with it. He created a sword for his arrogant bodyguard, Gundak, and transferred Ilfain's spirit from the host gem into the sword. Ilfain, always highly critical in life, started telepathically criticizing Gundak in combat. Gundak became annoyed with the sword after two weeks, and he threw it into the street. A series of warriors picked it up and discarded it after short periods of ownership. Over time, the weapon came to be known by the name Cynicism.

He traveled for forty years and is known for some of the most unique, haunting melodies in Faerun.

Unfortunately for Alerri, Lady Firehair's followers employed charm magic to cease the Banite's antics. Once he had been charmed, Alerri was commanded to perform all sorts of embarrassing actions in the streets of Waterdeep. After many years, Alerri decided to honor his god of hate by creating a suit of armor that would protect him from charm magic. He communed with the spiritual minions of Bane to discover the materials and rituals necessary for the suit's creation. Following his master's instructions, he murdered thirteen married couples and had their wedding rings woven into the hem of the mail. He then killed thirteen elves and bathed in their blood, uttering prayers for thirteen hours. When he was finished, his armor protected him from the magic of the Sunites and filled him with irrepressible hate. Alerri went on a crusade against the agents of Sune, Llira, and Hanali Celanil for three years. His killing spree ended when elven archers and priests of Corellon Larethian laid a trap for him on a road going north from Waterdeep.

Mithran was well known for his love of travel and his acceptance of the "N'Tel'Quessir," or "not people," the non-elven people of the world. The cloak was actually the cause of his doom, for it was woven and enchanted by his dark elf lover, Rauva Vrinn. The style of the black and midnight-blue cloak was so obviously non-elven that his associates became suspicious. 

Eventually, an acquaintance of Mithran, an elven drow-hunter named Gaedel, discovered Rauva's secluded hiding spot in the forests surrounding Myth Nantar. With a small band of warriors, Gaedel stormed her hut and quickly killed her. When Mithran discovered what had happened, he went berserk with fury. The mad mage assaulted the hunting lodge of Gaedel and his brothers, killing them all and leveling the lodge. Gaedel's family eventually attempted to take vengeance for the act, killing Mithran at the loss of most of their house. Mithran's cloak was recovered by his close friend, the dwarven warrior Hael Bronzelake. Had it not been, it would have been swallowed up under the waves with Myth Nantar when that proud city was drowned in the Sea of Fallen Stars several years later.

Legedain was growing old and becoming tired of his frail body. To remedy the situation, he cast Magic Jar and forced Ilfain's spirit into a host gem. Legedain then transferred his soul to the young elf's body and left the gem on a shelf nearby. One hundred years later, Legedain decided to do something with it. He created a sword for his arrogant bodyguard, Gundak, and transferred Ilfain's spirit from the host gem into the sword. Ilfain, always highly critical in life, started telepathically criticizing Gundak in combat. Gundak became annoyed with the sword after two weeks, and he threw it into the street. A series of warriors picked it up and discarded it after short periods of ownership. Over time, the weapon has simply come to be known by its current name.

Sages believe that Erion's intense opposition to holy men and women actually generated sympathetic magical powers in his weapon. Priests of Selune in Westgate confiscated the axe when they killed Erion in self-defense. It is currently believed that Erion is one of the unbelievers used as a building block in Myrkul's Bone Castle.

@196  = ~Skullflail, or "The Flail of Teeth" as it is more commonly known, was constructed in 1035 DR for the barbarian warlord Wychgar. During a battle in the northern wastes which became known as Hallowed Pass, Wychgar lost his three brothers to the orc army led by Kraag the Mighty. Wychgar was distraught and during the night he wandered the battlefield looking for their bodies to take away for proper burial. He stumbled across them and was visited by the brothers' spirits who were trapped between the land of the living and the land of the dead. Unable to help them leave he had their souls stored in the flail with the help of a shaman.

The three heads of the flail are his brother's skulls, which are attached to the shaft by silver chains. The three skull-heads grin maniacally at their new life. When the flail is used in combat the three heads bite the target, tearing and rending flesh.

The three elves made a pact to avenge their kin in ten years time. The subsequent adventures of the trio were immortalized in Merador of Waterdeep's epic "Three Avengers" ballads. The songs, sixteen in number, tell all of the adventures that the group went on. From "The Ballad of the Goblin King" to "The Ballad of Green Night," every deed is retold. Unfortunately, the history of Galain's gauntlets end with the final bars of "Green Night." The rest is shrouded in mystery.

When Glimglam was killed by a fire giant king, Enetta stitched a crude red heart onto the breast of the cloak. He was buried with it. Twenty years after Glimglam died, human thieves robbed his grave and stole the cloak. Those thieves later sold the cloak to ogres in exchange for wine and traveling rights through a particularly dangerous portion of the High Moor.

Instead, she devoted herself to performing ballads to the suffering throngs of Ilmatari everywhere. She was traveling with a group of Ilmatari pilgrims when they were attacked by bandits. The bandits killed and severely injured many of the pilgrims, and they cut the strings of Sephica's harp when she tried to soothe the injured travelers. After the bandits had left, Sephica prayed to Ilmater for help in a time of crisis. When she plucked at her harp strings with her eyes closed in prayer, music miraculously poured forth and healed every person who heard it. The next day, the bandits arrived and killed Sephica for healing the pilgrims. Though she was killed, the pilgrims kept the memory of her miracle alive. Their community attempted to have her accepted as an Ilmatari saint. They succeeded in 1218 DR.

It earned its name in Durlow's service, where he used it to drive back drow wizards and their summoned abyssal allies. Legends say that Durlow even defeated one of the dreaded Yochlol, the "Handmaidens of Lolth." Durlow met his end when the drow employed treachery to defeat him. Under magical disguise, drow assassins visited Durlow's fortified city as human ambassadors from Tethyr. They then poisoned Durlow's food, which he ate in front of them. Durlow eventually realized what was happening and managed to stumble to his room and grab Hellpick. In the resulting battle, Durlow managed to kill four of the five assassins before he fell victim to the effects of the poison. The fifth assassin is believed to have escaped.

Chautog's unusual story began when his village was destroyed in the crossfire from a battle between two rival wizard factions. One of the victors, the enchanter Shandellon, felt a twinge of guilt when he surveyed the collateral damage and as atonement took in the village's only survivor and raised the young orc as his son. 

Under Shandellon's tutelage, Chautog proved adept at magic despite his crude heritage. However, Chautog constantly found himself working harder than Shandellon's human apprentices and producing inferior results. As jealousy overtook him, Chautog locked himself in his room and toiled day and night on an enchanted item that would allow him to compete with his peers.

The fruit of his labor, though fairly unattractive, was an amazing helmet that would dramatically increase the power of the wearer's spells. Chautog immediately donned his prize. However, he quickly discovered that ignorance can be a boon to one whose existence is as pathetic as that of a jealous orc. Shandellon found the charred remains of his adopted son, still wearing the now coal-black helmet, next to a note bearing one simple sentence: "Some things are best left undone."

The helm served Illian well until he went hunting a great stag on Cinnaelos'Cor, an elven holiday. When the stag leapt into a thick patch of vines and briars, Illian followed. As Illian leapt through the tangle, the huge horns of the helm became caught, jerking his head violently. He was found dead the next day with a broken neck.

@220  = ~This helm was worn by the dwarven warrior Danel Silverfrost, king and martyr of the lost dwarven city-state of Silverrock. Danel's deeds are not as well known as those of many other heroic dwarves, but that is perhaps because his kingdom died with him. His nation suffered heavy losses when trolls and giants attacked it over a thousand years ago in the nearly forgotten "War of Curdling Blood." The war between the tribes of monsters and the kingdom of Silverrock was waged over fifteen years. Danel never attempted to flee his kingdom, seek the aid of neighboring countries, or abandon his people. Despite the fact that many of his subjects did indeed flee, Danel remained in Silverrock until the very end. Before the final battle of the terrible war, Danel told his people, "When ye see this plume on me head fall, I want ye to make sure that our people don't bow, like gold, but that they break, like iron."

Almost as soon as the battle was joined, Danel charged to the front of the fray and leapt into the talons of a dozen trolls. The moment his plume disappeared from sight, every man, woman, and child remaining in Silverrock poured out of the fortified caverns and dragged down as many trolls and giants as they could. Barrels of flaming oil were dumped all over Danel's palace and the common areas of the city, consuming as many dwarves as trolls and terrible frost giants. In the end, the monsters had achieved a Pyrrhic victory. The dwarven city was a smoldering ruin from which little treasure, no slaves, and no food could be taken. Many trolls died of starvation that winter, and when they turned on their giant allies for sustenance, the entire army fell into disarray forever.

To tap into the power behind these currents, Giddeon stated, a wizard simply needed to understand how they functioned. Once he or she understood the flow of energy, he or she could theoretically draw power from it through spellcasting or through a "focus device." When Giddeon's laboratory was destroyed by a colossal explosion in 1010 DR, this spear was one of the only items that survived.

When thrown, the spear's enchantments let it channel the natural currents of energy, causing it to form a Lance of Disruption. It then returns to the wielder.

Kossuth appeared in a gigantic bonfire and did battle with the enormous supernatural beast. The god's avatar triumphed over the octopus, but the monster did manage to damage Kossuth's essence. The divine fire raced through the creature's body and lodged in one of the creature's eyes, quickly transforming it into a bizarre black sphere lit by the flame within.

When he was finally captured by the elves, he stated emphatically that he was free of guilt because he was just following his orders. The elven council deemed that Denell be placed under a High Geas to carry his axe from the Sword Coast of Faerun to its borders in the east, and from the Great Glacier to Lurien. It took Denell thirty years to complete his task. When he finished, he was an accomplished warrior, weathered and beaten by years on foreign roads. On his way back to his home, he passed by Harrowdale and saw a wooden statue of Halvan the Dark raised proudly in a small town square. With a single-handed blow, he lodged his huge axe into Halvan's forehead. Never breaking stride, he returned to his hut, where he lived out the rest of his days as a reclusive farmer.

He paid over forty thousand gold pieces to have this halberd made, despite the fact that he only used the item to "cut" his fowl at his long dinner table. When Pelp died, he left the weapon to his pet goat, Azuth. In case of Azuth's death, the weapon would then be passed on to the first girl wearing a blue dress who entered his study. Twelve years after Azuth died, Pelp's niece, Amara, went into his study to find a book. The chamberlain of Pelp's mansion gave Long Cleaver to Amara when she turned sixteen. She sold the weapon to finance her entry into an academy of magic.

Kadan parted with the weapon, however, when he crossed paths with the infamous Nido Ochita Inazuma in western Faerun. Inazuma was the son of a Cormyrean knight and a Kara-Turian noblewoman. He claimed that his mother was struck by lightning twice while she was pregnant with Inazuma-once when she learned she had conceived and again immediately before she gave birth. Legends say that Inazuma was born on the edge of the Fateful Coin, the mystical method by which Tymora and Beshaba decide whether a person will have good or bad luck throughout his or her life. Sages believe that Inazuma's coin landed on edge, making him immune to the effects of weal and woe. When he came across Kadan and his scimitar, it was only a matter of time before the Zakharan gambled his scimitar and his life into Inazuma's hands.

When as much as a single snowflake falls upon the robe, it transforms into a scintillating cloak of white that allows the wielder to float above snow drifts and walk through even raging rivers with ease. Most merchants will not wish to purchase this item, or will do so at a very low price, as they see it as a sacred item of Auril the Frostmaiden and likely to attract her followers... and her displeasure.

Created during the ceremonies of the Coming Storm (the onset of winter) to Auril, these robes are specially created to resist flames and allow the wearer to resist any attempt to stop or hold them. Although the priestesses of Auril are naturally resistant to cold and can move through snow and icy rivers with ease, these cloaks amplify the protection of the goddess, allowing the wearer additional cold resistance (which allows a wearer already immune to cold to absorb its power) and even goes so far as to leach the heat from fire attacks directed at the wearer. In addition, the robe may be invoked to allow the wearer to pass over or through any obstacle designed to hold them, such as Web spells, ghoul paralyzation, Hold Person spells, and the like.

Kell led a peaceful life, fending off the occasional orc or goblin who might wander into his lands. When he died of old age, the druids had no one to pass the blade on to. The oldest of them, Bimon, held on to the scimitar, but never used it in battle. When Bimon and his associates left their grove for an extended period of time, a wandering mercenary robbed the hollow tree of its riches.

When he put on these robes, proud men stood aside and braggarts stilled their tongues. For all of Ogi-Luc's pride and prowess, he was unable to defeat the Red Wizard abjurer Nesk Vhaltim.

When her family urged her to find a husband, she issued a challenge to the men of the land: Whoever could make her yield in single combat could have her hand. The suitors gathered from all across Kara-Tur to test their skill, and although she fought with no weapons but her open hands, she bested every single one of them. Disappointed, all suitors left but one-a young man with kind eyes and a pair of gilded bracers, which he presented to her as a gift. "No one can hope to tame your passions," he said, "and those who would try will never understand your heart. May these trinkets serve as a reminder that your temper is your own and not to be controlled." Lin Mei did not marry that man, but she left home with him that day to seek adventure, and together they spent the rest of their lives in closer partnership than any husband and wife. Eventually the pair retired, and Lin Mei quietly disappeared from the annals of history. All that remains of her story are the bracers she wore, still burning with the fire of her untamed passion.

Yet when he discovered the merchant's gift, so the story goes, Sarutobi refused to wear the bracers, saying "I will crush this giant's skull with my bare hands, and I need no magic to help me do it!" Sarutobi carried the day, and the merchant locked the bracers away in his safe. When Sarutobi disappeared one day through a planar door, the merchant took the opportunity to give the bracers to Sarutobi's son, as small compensation for the loss of his father. The boy took the bracers and devoted his life to searching for his father. He never found him.

The truth is both less interesting and more: the source of Geraq's power was a strange stone, which the goblin carried everywhere he went. Where he found the stone is a mystery, as well as where it went after Geraq's mysterious disappearance, but holding it in one's hand, one can hear the whispers of Geraq's expertise sounding across the centuries. Of course, the whispers are all spoken in the language of goblins, making them more or less useless to the humanoid races; even so, the stone bestows greater knowledge on any who possess it.

Kay made dozens of enemies everywhere he went because of his acidic wit and appetite for confrontation. Sages believe that Milil frowned upon Pellon's antics, but that Talos found Pellon's attitude to be quite amusing. The avatar of Talos watched Pellon start a fight with over twenty men in a bar one night. As a gift for such destructive entertainment, Talos touched the lute that was laying next to Pellon's unconscious body. After that night, Pellon discovered that he could make men go berserk just by playing his lute in their direction. He took great delight in setting mercenaries and sailors against each other for several weeks. Eventually, Pellon Kay was laid low by a grim-featured warrior with a crossbow who didn't let Pellon get close enough to employ his magical lute. The unknown warrior threw the lute into the Sea of Fallen Stars.

Bards sing about the various near-death experiences he escaped from in the simple, if long-winded, tune, "The One Hundred Lives of Ket the Keen." He was also known for two of the weapons he carried. One was his short sword, Bloodfarmer. The other was his dagger, Reliance. It is said that Ket kept this dagger on his person for all of his days, never turning it over to any man, nor keeping it out of arm's reach at any time. He was actually kicked out of the Cormyrean royal court for his stubborn insistence on keeping Reliance, unbound, by his side. The dagger is cursed, and Ket's unwillingness to let go of the dagger most likely stemmed from the curse. After he died, Ket's extremely large family decided to donate the dagger to the church of Arvoreen. The church later gave it to a promising young halfling paladin. The paladin was killed later when he turned over the dagger (after casting Remove Curse) upon entering a seemingly friendly camp. His hosts turned out to be a pack of bandits. They killed the poor halfling on the spot.

Matthain, as the heir to the family, took it upon himself to remove the curse. The Chamberlain Haunt told Matthain that he must kill one hundred and one knights of the king.

Matthain began his grim task, slaughtering every knight he came across. He brought the skull and shield of each warrior to the Chamberlain Haunt as proof of his deed. The king dispatched bands of knights and heroes to kill Matthain, but he proved too difficult a foe. Finally, after three years of murdering, Matthain had killed one hundred knights. He told the Chamberlain Haunt that it was time to end the curse. The Chamberlain Haunt corrected him, reminding the fallen paladin that he had to kill one hundred and one knights of the king.

Overcome with misery and regret, Matthain nodded and immediately threw himself on his own spear. With Matthain and Garlan dead, and the letter of his requirements fulfilled, the curse was ended and the Chamberlain Haunt was called to Acheron by Bane, screaming all the way.

@432  = ~This grim staff, of a most despicable repute, was originally carved from the wood of Dead Man's Tree: an ancient black willow that stood on the outskirts of a forgotten hamlet of the Moonshae's, from which criminals were hung. All manner of bandits, murderers, rapists, and other worthies were left dangling from its knotty limbs; and all to the delight of the gravedigger Mordigan. For Mordigan, a secret practitioner of the necromantic arts, saw ample opportunity in which to ply his trade. Interring the remains of the evil men within close proximity of the tree, Mordigan called upon the dark powers of the negative material to perform a baleful act upon the black willow. It was given a sort of semi-sentience, and the ability to feed upon the remains of those who had so recently swung from its branches. Black roots descended into rotting flesh; and alarmingly enough, the tortured visages of the slain began to appear in the twisted knots of the black willow's bole before its burning. But, to the surprise of the villagers, the potently ensorcelled staff carved by the hands of the evil Mordigan did indeed prove to be their undoing. And thus did the hanged men of Dead Man's Tree have their revenge.

@433  = ~This pair of impossibly heavy boots was owned by the Thentian explorer Bordel "Stomper" Farpath. Bordel was famed throughout the Moonsea for his hiking contests. Bordel and a group of fellow explorers would specify a location in Faerun to march to. The contestants would then hike to the location by the quickest route possible. Bordel won far more of the competitions than he lost, and he had a reputation for having extremely heavy footsteps. This earned him the nickname "Stomper." When Bordel died in a rockslide, he was buried in the wilderness. Several years after his death, rumors began circulating that Bordel's boots were actually enchanted to make him sound loud when he approached. This rumor spiraled out of control, eventually going so far as to say that Bordel's boots were capable of shaking down houses with their weight. By the time thieves stole the boots ten years after Bordel's death, they had taken on the properties that so many people believed they possessed. The boots are so heavy that only a humanoid with titan-like strength would be able to walk in them. But if such a humanoid were to exist, he or she would make the earth tremble with each step while these boots were worn.

He simply held his ground and destroyed everyone that came near him.

When the envoy's caravan was ambushed by a small band of yuan-ti raiders, most of the guards were quickly dispatched during a surprise attack, save for one wagon and the young woman defending it. In wave after wave, the yuan-ti charged at the officer, and in wave after wave, they were cut down by the speed and fury of her steel. At last the leader of the yuan-ti raiders faced off with the young woman, and although he did finally overpower her, he was astonished by her skill. The katana she carried was recovered and later enchanted by a high priest of Sseth. The once graceful blade was tainted by dark magic and now guides those who wield it to inflict the severest of wounds upon their enemies.

He was especially well known for his lack of fear of the undead. He considered undead to be, in his words, "unoriginal, tired old jokes." "After the hundredth skeleton," he would say, "what's to be afraid of? They all march at you like horses to water, and you just hack them down one at a time. I'm supposed to be scared of that?" He would wade into tombs with his trusted flail and smash apart any undead that he found, joking all the way. Eventually, Seldon's lack of respect for the necromantic arts earned him an enemy in the form of Tiron, a lich of no small power. Tiron captured Seldon and paralyzed him, letting a group of skeletons beat him to death. Seldon's friends later recovered his body and had him raised from the dead. He was not as lighthearted about the walking dead after that.

@461  = ~The Salamander's Tongue +5~
@462  = ~A wicked-looking dagger with a dark history, the Salamander's Tongue is prized both for its use as a weapon and its hidden magical powers. The blade appears to be an exotic-looking dagger with a kris-like wavy blade ending in two small points. A small portion of a slimy, bright-red living salamander's tongue is somehow embedded in the heart of the blade, near the grip. It pulses and writhes randomly without intervention from the owner. 

The exact origins of the blade are unknown, but it is believed that the first owner of the weapon was a respected and feared gnomish thief and assassin from Westgate named Turlam Shallowhill. Turlam was killed in a fight with a rival, a halfling called Deder Seven Fingers. Deder kept the weapon as a trophy, not knowing its powers until after it was stolen by an underling, a fellow halfling named Kreshinal Blackhound. Kreshinal fled to Selgaunt with the dagger for five years, relying on its powers to hide him from divination. Kreshinal lost the dagger in a botched gambling scam and was killed by Deder's agents within the month. Deder attempted to reclaim the dagger from the Sembian criminals who had captured it. He succeeded at routing the thieves and reclaiming his dagger, but he focused so much attention on the blade that he didn't notice that the Sembian criminals had employed a priest of Mask to infiltrate and break down his interests in Westgate. The ensuing war between the Westgate and Selgaunt factions ended when the priest of Mask, Pieter the Feeble, made the two sides so paranoid that they ate themselves away from the inside. Pieter grabbed the dagger when he had the opportunity and escaped to Hillsfar, confident that the unorganized demihuman supporters of the late Deder Seven Fingers wouldn't follow him to a place so hostile to their kind.

In yet another scam, Pieter sold the blade to a Mulmaster Hawk while luring other potential buyers to an auction in Hillsfar. Pieter and his associates murdered the buyers at the fake auction and made off with the cash, hiding under the cover of an amulet of non-detection. The Mulmaster Hawk who purchased the blade was supposedly killed by priestesses of Umberlee who were angry at the assassin's refusal to pay tribute to the Bitch Queen. Years of factional fighting between the Umberlants are believed to have transported the blade as much as three thousand miles away from its humble beginnings in Sembia. The whereabouts of Pieter the Feeble and his goons are currently unknown.

The infamous Band of the Key was a group of occultist fighters who dedicated themselves to taking evil magical texts out of the hands of those who would use them to cause harm. The Band favored using crossbows over bows for their ability to remain cocked and ready for long periods of time. The leader of the Band, a thin, mustachioed man named Heglyf, enlisted some Deneirrath priests to craft these special bolts in large quantities. They can be easily recognized by their distinctive yellow and green fletching.

Shrewd and crafty by reputation, Makael applied his skills and the power of Turodahel carefully for over three decades. It wasn't until after Makael died of a magical disease that legends about the man started to spring up. It is believed by modern sages that Makael is likely to have killed over five hundred men with his sword over the years. It was widely known that Makael was neither especially strong nor tough. People assumed that it must have been the power of the sword that made his deeds possible. Makael's grave was robbed within a few years of his burial.

For the next few decades, warriors and thieves from all over the Moonsea and Dalelands schemed and murdered to get hold of Makael's legendary sword. One priest of Bane, curious about the sword's powers, stole Makael's skull for divination. When questioned about the magical abilities of the weapon, Makael's spirit answered from beyond the grave with one word, "turodahel." The Banite searched through his books for months before he discovered the origins of the word in a Netherese lexicon. Roughly translated, "turodahel" is a compound noun meaning "the power of discretion."

Valiant's owners survived through many incredible ordeals, mostly because of the magic of the weapon. The weapon was lost in Calimshan when a holy slayer pursued a pasha's blasphemous agents to Calimport. The scimitar remained in the hands of Baris Cabal for about a dozen years before the band was broken up by Ilban and his companions.

@593  = ~This instrument is also known as "Tallow's Violin," but that moniker is rarely spoken among musicians, as mentioning the name of Nikolai Tallow is considered bad luck. Nikolai was born in the Vast, near High Haspur, the son of a chandler. Because of the intermittent traffic through the region, Nikolai was introduced to many different cultures. One of the travelers he met was an elven musician named Relev Thinriver. Relev introduced Nikolai to the violin and taught him for several years as he wandered through the area. Relev knew that Nikolai was an incredibly gifted child, with quick fingers, a keen mind, and a passion for all things in the world. Relev also recognized that Nikolai was exceedingly proud and arrogant. In spite of Nikolai's shortcomings, Relev taught him everything he knew.

After Relev was killed by a band of orcs, Nikolai began to practice on his own throughout the Vast. Despite his travels, he always returned to the isolated peaks of his mountain birthplace. He became famed throughout the Vast, the southern Moonsea, and Sembia for his incredible talent and passionate performances. Eventually, news of the proud young virtuoso spread to the ears of a nearby thug from Calaunt named Tremble Ghon. When Tremble and his gang traveled through the Elvenblood Pass, they stopped at the Elf in Armor Inn and demanded a performance from Nikolai, who happened to be present and eating dinner with his father at the time.

Nikolai refused to perform for Tremble and his men. He called them stinking oafs and attempted to leave with dignity. Tremble assaulted Nikolai's pride by claiming that Nikolai was afraid of performing because he'd be heckled out of the inn for his incompetence. Nikolai shot back that his skill with the violin was so great that he could raise the dead from their graves. Satisfied with a proposed challenge, Tremble immediately grabbed Nikolai's father and stabbed him in the heart. When a number of other villagers attempted to intervene, they were also killed by the bandits.

Tremble defiantly stood over Nikolai's dead father and said, "Where's your big mouth now, fiddle player?" Without a word, Nikolai pulled his violin and bow out from underneath his arms and began to play a melody that none of the residents of High Haspur had ever heard before and no one in Faerun would ever hear again. Nikolai played with unbridled passion and fervor. Onlookers later remarked that he appeared to be a madman, thrashing about in ways that people didn't think were possible. At the climax of his frenzied piece, Tremble and his gang watched in horror as the souls of the men and women they had just killed rose from their corpses and dove, shrieking, at their murderers. The bandits died horrible deaths, chilled by the shadows of their victims. Nikolai himself continued playing, dancing through the streets and back pastures of his alpine home until every man, woman, child, and beast ever buried in the region rose from its resting place and milled about until Nikolai and his music disappeared into a far-off valley, shrouded in a mysterious fog that vanished as quickly as it had appeared.

Legends say that on misty nights, the ghost of Nikolai Tallow returns to his homeland, playing a phantom violin with a host of dancing dead trailing behind him in the moonlight.

The cloak twists in torchlight, each strand of hair raveling and unraveling about the others so subtly that it appears as if a light breeze is rippling the cloak.

This cloak is woven from the hair of virgins sent to the Burial Isle to sleep with their dead barbarian lords. It was the Seer's duty to comfort these women, to soothe their pain-in order to do so, she took a lock of hair from each and wove the strands into a cloak that would draw the spirits of fear from the virgins and steady their hearts. The result was a cloak that hangs heavy with guilt and does little to shield the wearer from the cold of the North. 

When worn, the hairs weave around the wielder's frame, the long strands lacing together like threads on a loom. The cloak will not willingly unravel itself from a wearer without being coerced by a Remove Curse spell.

Despite this, most theologians know very little about what happened to the unfortunate dying god whom the malefic trio consumed prior to their encounter with Jergal. What is known is that a small portion of the dead god's essence found its way to the Astral Plane, where it coalesced into one of the smallest islands of slain divinity. This small hunk of rock and odd ore was captured hundreds of years later by an enchanter named Merdros. Merdros's duergar servants created this blade for the wizard's most powerful warrior ally. Owners of the blade claimed that they could feel the dead god's final memories flowing through the weapon when they held it.

When Tamjuhk was sacked by efreet, githyanki, salamanders, and other malicious creatures, the efreeti Amir Talmed presented the weapon to the Grand Sultan of the City of Brass. Some time later, the Grand Sultan gave the weapon to Memnon, the efreeti who did battle with the djinni Calim over present-day Calimshan. Memnon used the weapon very little, deigning to give it to a powerful lieutenant. When Memnon and Calim fell to elven high magic, their servants fled or were driven back to their home planes. It is believed that the Wind of Heaven found its way back into the hands of the djinn after the epic war.

@623  = ~Pale Justice~
@624  = ~This sword was made with one purpose: to destroy evil. Though a powerful weapon, Pale Justice has humble beginnings. The plain sword was crafted by a devout worshipper of Tyr named Renold. Renold spent thirty years of his life perfecting the metalworking techniques that allowed him to craft an almost flawless blade. As soon as Renold had completed the unadorned weapon, he turned it over to the church of Tyr. The priest who received it placed the naked blade on his monastery's altar. He asked his brothers to join him in praying to Tyr to ask their god to bless the weapon with holy power. The brothers never touched the blade, nor did they speak of it. After ten years, despite the fact that all of the other brothers lost faith in the blade ever becoming enchanted, the original priest, Edan, continued his prayers in silence. Another twenty years passed, and there was still no sign from Tyr. Visiting priests of Helm scoffed at Edan's blind devotion to the blade. It was then that, without warning, Edan walked up to the altar and gently removed the dust-covered blade from the altar.

The priest of Helm asked Edan if he had finally come to his senses. Edan replied that he had, that he had been expecting the wrong thing from Tyr the entire time. He stated that Tyr had done his work long ago.

The priest of Helm laughed out loud at Edan's claim and asked his bodyguard to draw his sword. The magnificent weapon in the hand of the Helmite had a gilded guard set with pearls. Runes were etched along the blade, with a small cluster of fine rubies set in the ricasso. The priest of Helm laughed again and spoke. "This is truly a sword blessed by the gods. Your weapon looks like an ordinary soldier's blade. It pales in comparison."

Edan calmly grabbed the blade by the tang and swatted at the guard's weapon. The priest of Helm's laughter cut off quickly as he stared down at his retainer's broken weapon. He stood there speechless as Edan set the blade down and began to reply.

"Justice always pales in comparison to vanity and ostentatious displays of power. I expected Tyr to manifest his divine will in this blade with lightning and fire. I should have remembered how the blade was given to me... with simple charity and humility. Justice is the right of every man, no matter how rich or poor, no matter how educated or ignorant. It should be found as often in the fields of farmers as it is in the fields of battle."

Edan took the blade to a local weaponsmith and had him put a wooden, leather-wrapped grip on it. He then gave it to a fledgling paladin and asked him to always remember the potential for charity and kindness in the human race.

In the hands of a paladin, Pale Justice serves as a holy avenger. If wielded by anyone else, it is not much different from an ordinary long sword.

@625  = ~Pig's Eye~
@626  = ~A beautiful weapon with a mocking name, Pig's Eye is an elven blade dedicated to the slaying of orcs. Although its proper name is Gruumshacan, most people who know of the blade refer to it as Pig's Eye. The name is an allusion to the fateful blow which Corellon Larethian, patron of the elven race, inflicted upon Gruumsh, head of the orc pantheon. The glass-encased orc eye that rests in the hilt makes it easy to recognize.

The blade was crafted in 239 DR by an elven enchanter and weaponsmith named Shenarr Caith. After he had finished imbuing the weapon with its power, he gave it to his cousin, the ranger Velaic Caith, who put it to extensive use against orcs near Cormanthyr. His son, Tredain, and his grandson, Galesic, also employed the blade for hundreds of years without misfortune. Eventually, the Caith family decided to make the long migration to Evermeet. As Gruumshacan was not the family's moonblade, the Caiths decided to trade the weapon for some of the funds necessary to transform their ancient uncle Shenarr into a baelnorn. The last recorded remarks from Shenarr indicate that he was more than slightly amused at how the little blade had helped him defy death.

@627  = ~Alamion +5~
@628  = ~This long sword is part of a matched pair of weapons, the other being the short sword Malamion. Alamion's blade is slightly thinner than a typical long sword blade and features a thin fuller down the center. Acid-etched snowflake patterns are scattered along the length of the blade, most of them concentrated towards the hilt. The hilt of the sword is made of bronze sandwiched between two off-white pieces of ivory carved to show clouds unleashing winds and snow. The grip is covered with mother-of-pearl lashed securely into place with bronze wire. The pommel of the weapon is a solid bronze globe with the snowflake lozenge of Auril etched into the bottom.

The full history of this blade and its brother have been well documented. Roughly two hundred years ago, a wizard from Shannath named Obren the Left-Handed was hired to make a pair of swords for the glory of Auril. Obren reluctantly did so, producing Alamion ("Frost Daddy") and Malamion ("Frost Baby") over a five year period. After a dispute about Obren's fee, priests of Auril tried to take the sword from him by force. The exact outcome of the battle is unclear, but Obren's swords did not end up in the hands of Auril's faithful. Thirty years later, a warrior named Berdino in Procampur bragged that he had a blade that could kill demons in a single strike. Berdino was found dead on the shore two tendays later, the victim of many poisoned crossbow bolts.

The new owner of Alamion was a vain, egotistical thief called Pellas the Fair. Pellas had acquired Malamion, quite by accident, fourteen years earlier and strongly desired its brother when he learned of its existence. Pellas held onto the swords until he died at the hands of a paladin named Garijon Renold of Torm. Garijon found the blades invaluable in his battles against the fiery denizens of the outer planes, and the two swords were passed on for generations from paladin to paladin.

Heleban of Ithmong, a paladin of Tyr, was the last warrior known to have used the swords. His battles against slavers and pirates on the Sword Coast are believed to have brought him to an untimely end.

@633  = ~Selune's Promise +3~
@634  = ~A weapon once owned by a grief-stricken high priestess of the Moonmaiden, Selune's Promise has a short and sad history. Fassa the Melancholy (as she is now known) was the head of a band of Selunite adventurers dedicated to destroying undead wherever they found them. The band was initially quite successful, rarely suffering any casualties. Tymora's luck could not stay with them forever, though.

In 1156, Fassa and her band entered the Sepulcher of the Dim. The band knew the Sepulcher was rumored to contain a "leak" to the Negative Material Plane, but they had no idea just how many undead creations were inside. Mixed in with the seemingly harmless poltergeists and phantoms were powerful specters and wraiths. Over a short and chillingly quiet period of several minutes, almost all of Fassa's allies had their vital energy drained away. Fassa and her remaining companions fled and tried to form a plan of attack. When they returned on the following night, all of Fassa's former companions had been turned into slave specters under the control of the master. She and her few remaining comrades destroyed the master specter and eventually destroyed the souls of her tormented brethren. In the end, Fassa was the only one left alive.

Fassa returned to her temple in misery and prayed to Selune that she never forget the agony of that night. Selune granted her request by causing a ghostly white and blue mace to appear on her bed when the next full moon rose. Carved into the shaft of the weapon were two words: Never Forget.

Fassa became almost fanatical in her undead hunting in later years. At the age of thirty-three, tired and bitter, Fassa fell into decline. On the night of a full moon, she renounced her faith to Selune in front of her superiors and fellow clergy. Hours later, she threw herself into the Moonsea from a high cliff. The mace was found in her room and reluctantly kept in the church. Many years later, the new high priest of the temple decided that the weapon had an unpleasant legacy and should be thrown into the Moonsea. The history of the mace ends with this event.

The elf's tower was also filled with a variety of abnormal spiders. For over a year, Caligope refused to even look at the tower. Eventually, he decided to construct a club to deal with his fear.

@646  = ~Big Black Flying-Death +3~
@647  = ~The gargantuan throwing axe known as Big Black Flying-Death is an orcish weapon through and through. Carried to the final battle of the Hand of Seldarine by the hulking orc warlord Yellow-Toothed Grubrun Foul-Tusks, Big Black Flying-Death had its origins in an ogre mercenary's two-handed battle-axe. After a particular vicious raid on a dwarven mining settlement, Grubrun spied the axe lodged in the skull of a dead dwarven marshal. It seems that an ogre mercenary had impaled himself upon the marshal's spear in a careless charge, but his last act had been to nearly cleave his killer's head in twain and, in trying to wrench the axe free for a second blow, shattering the haft before expiring in a bloody heap.

Prying the huge, black cold-iron blade from the base of the dwarf's skull, Grubrun returned to his fortress at Nab-Nurog and had his shaman set to enchanting it. Not having considered fixing the shaft and finding it too heavy and awkward to use in melee, Grubrun deigned to use the weapon as a throwing axe and demanded that it be ensorcelled to return to his hands after being hurled. The warlord found great delight in heaving the enormous weapon about, roaring with glee as Big Black Flying-Death came careening back to him, gleaming and gore-spattered, after lopping some poor enemy in two at the waist.

Grubrun Foul-Tusks finally met his end at the final battle of the Hand where he threw Big Black Flying-Death at the elven weapon master Kaylessa; she deftly sidestepped the flying weapon, darted forward, and ran her own blade through the empty-handed orc's belly. Kaylessa was said to have then coolly ducked as Grubrun's own axe came whirling back at him and cleanly severed his head, rotten yellow tusks and all.

Big Black Flying-Death is an especially large axe - almost ridiculously so - and is only identifiable as a throwing weapon because of its short haft and the manner in which it's weighted. In fact, the axe is so massive that it cannot be thrown with a single hand, requiring the wielder to grip it with both hands and hurl it sidelong with the strength of their entire body.

Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the Beast Master to attempt to summon a familiar to act as <PRO_HISHER> aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit its master, conveying its sensory powers to <PRO_HIMHER>, conversing with <PRO_HIMHER>, and serving as a guard/scout/spy as well. A Beast Master can have only one familiar at a time, and <PRO_HESHE> has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any come at all.

Note: Only one party member may have a familiar.

The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically by 2 or 3 Intelligence points), and its bond with the Beast Master confers upon it an exceptionally long life. The Beast Master has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands. The Beast Master receives half the familiar's total Hit Points (rounded down) as bonus Hit Points. However, the Beast Master must take care to treat <PRO_HISHER> familiar well, for if the familiar should die, the Beast Master loses the bonus Hit Points and the familiar's Hit Points again as damage. Also, when a familiar dies, the Beast Master loses 1 point of Constitution PERMANENTLY.

Example: A Beast Master has 30 Hit Points and casts Find Familiar. The fairy dragon summoned has 24 Hit Points, so the Beast Master gets a bonus of 12 Hit Points. The Beast Master now has 42 Hit Points. If the familiar dies, the Beast Master loses those 12 Hit Points (putting <PRO_HIMHER> back at 10), loses 1 point of Constitution permanently (which may cause additional Hit Point loss), and takes 12 damage.

Here is a list of the familiars that the Beast Master receives according to alignment:

@2514=~BLACKGUARD: The Blackguard epitomizes evil and is nothing short of a mortal fiend. The quintessential black knight, this villain carries a reputation of the foulest sort that is very well deserved. Consorting with demons and devils and serving dark deities, the Blackguard is hated and feared by all. Some people call these villains "anti-paladins" due to their completely evil nature.

Advantages:

@2515=~CLERIC: The Cleric is a generic priest (of any mythos) who tends to the spiritual needs of a community. Though <PRO_HESHE> is both protector and healer, <PRO_HESHE> is not purely defensive-when evil threatens, the Cleric is well suited to seek it out on its own ground and destroy it. The opposite is true of evil Clerics as well, and there are also many variations in between.

CLASS FEATURES:

- May wear helmets.
- May wear any armor.
- May only use non-bladed, non-piercing weapons (war hammer, club, flail, mace, quarterstaff, sling).

- May cast Storm Shield once per day. Gains one use at level 1 and an additional use every 10 levels thereafter.

STORM SHIELD: This spell lasts 1 round per level of the caster. It protects the caster from lightning, fire, cold, and normal missiles.

The weapon sets the Cleric's number of attacks per round to 3 and lasts for 1 round per level.

Disadvantages:
- Alignment restricted to lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, and true neutral.~

@2519=~PRIEST OF TYR: Tyr is the deity of law and justice and is primarily concerned with the punishment of wrongdoers and the general furthering of law and good in the world. The belief in justice through (benevolent) force, or at least armed vigilance, is the reason for Tyr's existence. Tyr holds great prominence in the pantheon due to his position as leader of the Triad, a trio of lawful good gods that are collectively devoted to the concepts of courage, justice, perseverance, relief of suffering, duty, obedience, honor, and to some extent, righteous martyrdom.

Disadvantages:
- Alignment restricted to lawful good, neutral good, or lawful neutral.~
@2520=~PRIEST OF TEMPUS: Tempus, also known as the Lord of Battles or the Foehammer, is random in his favors, yet his chaotic nature favors all sides equally.

Tempuran clergy can be found on both sides of a conflict, as none can ever truly know whom the war god will favor.

Advantages:

The magnitude of the effect starts at 1 (5 for Hit Points) at level 1 and will improve by 1 (5 for Hit Points) every 6 levels of the caster, to a maximum of 9 for a 48th level caster.

Disadvantages:
- Alignment restricted to chaotic good, chaotic neutral, chaotic evil, or true neutral.~

Prime Requisites For Dual-Classing: Wisdom, Charisma~
@2522=~TOTEMIC DRUID: This Druid closely identifies with a particular animal, an animal that <PRO_HESHE> feels represents <PRO_HISHER> spirit. This grants <PRO_HIMHER> a special connection to the animal kingdom, and <PRO_HESHE> is able to call upon their spirits to aid <PRO_HIMHER>.

Advantages:
- May use the Summon Spirit Animal ability once per day. Gains one use at level 1 and an additional use every 5 levels thereafter.

SUMMON SPIRIT ANIMAL: The Totemic Druid summons a special spirit animal (spirit bear, spirit wolf, spirit lion, or spirit snake) to aid <PRO_HIMHER> for 6 turns.

Disadvantages:
- Cannot use shapeshift.~
@2523=~SHAPESHIFTER: This Druid is not called Shapeshifter because <PRO_HESHE> has access to a great variety of forms, but rather because of <PRO_HISHER> complete dedication to a single alternate form. This Druid has willingly allowed <PRO_HIMHER>self to become infected with lycanthropy, but due to intense study and training <PRO_HESHE> has the ability to control <PRO_HISHER> affliction. The creature <PRO_HESHE> becomes is that of the werewolf, the most famous of the lycanthrope shape changers.

- 13th level: May shapeshift into a greater werewolf once per day.

@2524=~AVENGER: A member of a special sect within the druidic order, a Druid of this type is dedicated to fighting those who would defile nature. Avengers have powers the average Druid does not-additional abilities that have been earned through extensive rituals, a process that is very physically draining.

- Incurs a -2 penalty to Strength and Constitution.~
@2525=~MAGE: The wizard strives to be a master of magical energies, shaping them and casting them as spells. To do so, <PRO_HESHE> studies strange tongues and obscure facts and devotes much of <PRO_HISHER> time to magical research. A wizard must rely on knowledge and wit to survive. Wizards are rarely seen adventuring without a retinue of fighters and men-at-arms. Because there are different types (or schools) of magic, there are different types of wizards. The Mage studies all types of magic and learns a wide variety of spells; <PRO_HISHER> broad range makes <PRO_HIMHER> well suited to the demands of adventuring.

CLASS FEATURES:

- May only use the following weapons: dagger, quarterstaff, dart, sling.
- May only become Proficient (one slot) in any weapon class.

@2527=~THIEF: To accomplish <PRO_HISHER> goals, for good or ill, the Thief is a skilled pilferer. Cunning, nimbleness, and stealth are <PRO_HISHER> hallmarks.

@2536=~SORCERER: Sorcerers are practitioners of magic who were born with the innate ability to cast spells. It is thought that the blood of some powerful creature flows through their veins; perhaps they are the spawn of the gods themselves, or even dragons walking in humanoid form. Regardless, the Sorcerer's magic is intuitive rather than logical. They know fewer spells than Mages, and acquire spells more slowly, but they can cast spells more often and have no need to select and prepare spells ahead of time. Sorcerers cannot specialize in magic the way Mages do. Other than these differences, a Sorcerer is very similar to a Mage.

- May only use the following weapons: dagger, quarterstaff, dart, sling.
- May only become Proficient (one slot) in any weapon class.
- May not place any slots in any fighting style.

@2541=~SHAMAN: Shamans forge a divine connection with the natural world, similar to the way Druids commune with nature, but Shamans are more spiritual than primal. They directly tap into the energies that flow through the earth and air, through plants and animals, and even through the dead, and shape these energies to obey their will. Nowhere is this more evident than in their ability to summon powerful spirits as guardians and defenders. A being of two worlds, Shamans value balance over dominance.

CLASS FEATURES:

- May only wear leather, studded leather, and hide armor.
- May not equip shields larger than bucklers.
- May only use the following weapons: dagger, club, spear, axe, quarterstaff, dart, sling, and shortbow.
- May only become Proficient (one slot) in any weapon class.
- May only become Proficient (one slot) in any fighting style.
- May cast druidic spells.
- Does not automatically learn all spells of a given level as Druids do. Instead, Shamans select new spells to learn at each level, which they can cast daily without memorization.
- Gains access to a number of Shaman-specific spells, which can be cast like any other: Spirit Ward, Writhing Fog, Spiritual Clarity, Spirit Fire, Recall Spirit, Spiritual Lock, Ether Gate, and Ethereal Retribution.
- Gains use of the Detect Illusion skill with 20% points as a base and an 4 points per level, up to a maximum of 220% at level 50.
- May use Shamanic Dance at will.

SHAMANIC DANCE: Shamans can summon spirit allies by performing a ritualistic dance. While dancing, the Shaman cannot perform any action other than moving. Each round while the Shaman dances, there is a 50% base chance plus 2% for each level of the Shaman that a spirit will answer the call, up to a maximum of 100% at level 25. Any summoned spirits will disappear if the Shaman moves, stops dancing, or if the spirits leave visual range. The spirits grow in power as the Shaman gains additional levels:
  Level 1: Minor animal spirits (snake, fox, hound), up to 2 spirits at the same time.
  Level 6: Major animal spirits (bear, panther, boar), up to 3 spirits at the same time.
  Level 12: Minor nature spirits (lesser air spirit, lesser earth spirit, lesser fire spirit), up to 4 spirits at the same time.
  Level 18: Major nature spirits (air spirit, earth spirit, fire spirit), up to 5 spirits at the same time.
The type of the summoned spirit is randomly determined from all the spirits available at the Shaman's level. For example, a level 12 Shaman will summon either a minor nature spirit, a major animal spirit, or a minor animal spirit, but cannot choose which one appears. Spirits will do their best to protect the Shaman but are not controlled directly.
- 21st level: May cast Spirit Form once per day. Gains an additional use at levels 32 and 43.

SPIRIT FORM: The shaman slips into a space between the spirit world and the material plane, rendering them partially incorporeal. For the next 5 rounds, all physical attacks directed against the shaman deal 50% of their normal damage. During this time, the shaman is also under the effects of Improved Invisibility and cannot be directly targeted by spells.

- 24th level: May cast Favored of the Spirits once per day. Gains an additional use at levels 36 and 48.

FAVORED OF THE SPIRITS: This powerful rite shields the Shaman from death for 1 hour or until discharged. While under the protection of this rite, the Shaman is immune to all forms of death magic. In addition, if the Shaman is reduced below 10% Hit Points and the rite is active, the Shaman instantly receives the benefit of a Heal spell. The rite's protection (including the immunity to death) is completely discharged once the Heal spell is triggered.

- 25th level: The Shaman now always summons the most powerful spirits <PRO_HESHE> can call.
- 30th level: The Shaman can now summon any number of spirits at a time, and the spirits ignore the summoning limit.
- 40th level: The Shaman now summons two spirits each round while dancing.

This powerful abjuration spell causes the spells cast against the priest to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total number of spell levels equal to half the level of the caster. It includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes area effects that are not centered directly upon the priest and area effects that are stationary, such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud.

As long as there are levels remaining, the spell will be absorbed. For example, if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the priest, the spell will be absorbed while canceling the shield.

In addition, Shield of the Archons protects the priest from Dispel Magic, Remove Magic, and other dispelling effects.~

Range: 40 ft.
Duration: 10 rounds
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius 
Saving Throw: Special

Ghostly figures called by the Shaman swirl around the battlefield, tormenting the Shaman's adversaries.

Duration: 9 hours
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature

It lasts until successfully dispelled or until the duration runs out.~

(Divination)

Level: 1
Range: 0
Duration: 9 seconds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster

@21116=~Sleep
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Monsters with 7 or more Hit Dice are unaffected, but any number of enemies with 6 Hit Dice or less can be put to sleep, regardless of their total Hit Dice. There is no Saving Throw. Though it's not the stuff of which legends are made, attacks against magically sleeping opponents never miss-although they will awaken after the first hit.~
@21117=~Chill Touch
(Necromancy)

Level: 1
Range: Touch
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

When the caster completes this spell, a blue glow encompasses <PRO_HISHER> hand, and <PRO_HESHE> uses this energy to attack the life force of an adjacent creature. No attack roll is needed. The touched creature takes 5d4 magic cold damage and must Save vs. Death or lose 3 points of Strength for 5 rounds. The Strength loss is cumulative; if the creature is reduced to 0 Strength, it dies instantly.

An undead creature suffers no damage or Strength loss from Chill Touch, but will be affected by panic for 2 turns unless it successfully makes a Save vs. Spell.~
@21119=~Larloch's Minor Drain
(Necromancy)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the wizard drains the life force from a target and adds it to <PRO_HISHER> own. The target creature suffers 12 magic damage, while the wizard gains 12 Hit Points. If the wizard goes over <PRO_HISHER> maximum Hit Point total with this spell, <PRO_HESHE> loses them after 1 hour. This spell has no effect on constructs or undead.~
@21123=~Find Familiar
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 1
Range: n/a
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 familiar
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to attempt to summon a familiar to act as <PRO_HISHER> aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit a wizard, conveying its sensory powers to its master, conversing with <PRO_HIMHER>, and serving as a guard/scout/spy as well. A wizard can have only one familiar at a time, and <PRO_HESHE> has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any come at all.

(Note: This spell may only be cast by the protagonist.)

The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically by 2 or 3 Intelligence points), and its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life. The wizard has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands. The caster receives half the familiar's total Hit Points (rounded down) as bonus Hit Points. However, the caster must take care to treat <PRO_HISHER> familiar well, for if the familiar should die, the caster loses the bonus Hit Points and half the familiar's Hit Points again as damage. Also when a familiar dies, the caster loses 1 point of Constitution PERMANENTLY.

Example: A Mage has 24 Hit Points and casts Find Familiar. The imp summoned has 36 Hit Points, so the caster gets a bonus of 18 Hit Points. The caster now has 42 Hit Points. If the familiar dies, the caster loses those 18 Hit Points (putting <PRO_HIMHER> back at 24), loses 1 point of Constitution permanently (which may cause additional Hit Point loss), and takes 18 damage.

Here is a list of the familiars that the player receives according to alignment:

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

Upon casting this spell, a skull is thrown by the caster at the target area. The skull floats in the area until a creature comes within 8 ft. of it.

The magic damage inflicted is equal to 1d6 Hit Points per level of the caster (save vs. Breath for half), up to a maximum of 10d6. When casting this spell, it is wise to set it far away from the party lest they set it off accidentally. Resting or leaving the area the skull trap is in will make it disappear harmlessly.~

Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that prevents any 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell effects from penetrating (i.e. the area of effect of any such spell does not include the area of the Minor Globe Of Invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere with no penalty. The globe can be brought down by a successful Dispel Magic spell.~

Level: 4
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell causes a major disease and weakness in a creature if it fails a Save vs. Polymorph at -5.

Duration: 15 rounds

(Alteration)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 7 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell encloses the target in a globe of shimmering force for the duration of the spell. The resilient sphere is completely immune to all damage; the only method of removing the sphere is by the use of Dispel Magic. Hence, the creature caught inside the globe is completely safe from all attacks, but at the same time is completely unable to affect the outside world. Hostile creatures can resist the effect with Magic Resistance, but there is no Saving Throw.~
@21414=~Spirit Armor
(Necromancy)

Level: 4
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell is very similar to the 3rd-level spell Ghost Armor in that it creates an incorporeal barrier around the target's body for the duration of the spell. This spell, however, actually taps in to the target's life force in order to create the barrier. The armor itself is weightless and does not hinder movement or spellcasting at all.

Spirit Armor does not work cumulatively with any other armor; however, Dexterity bonuses still apply, as well as magic rings and shield bonuses. While in effect, the Armor Class of the recipient will be 0, as if <PRO_HESHE> were wearing full plate +1. Also, due to the magical nature of the spell, <PRO_HESHE> will also receive a +3 bonus to saves vs. Spell.

There is a danger, however, as when the spell runs out, the external portion of the spirit is temporarily lost, inflicting 2d4 points of magic damage upon the target.~

(Enchantment)

Level: 4
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature

(Evocation, Alteration)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

The red fireshield protects the user from fire damage by surrounding the caster with a shield of flame. This shield does not only grant the user +50% Fire Resistance and +25% Magic Fire Resistances, it also protects <PRO_HIMHER> from attacks made from within a 5-ft. radius around <PRO_HIMHER>. An opponent that damages the caster within this radius suffers 1d8+2 points of fire damage.~
@21422=~Beltyn's Burning Blood
(Necromancy)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/2 levels
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell turns a target's blood to flame, doing 3d4 Hit Points of damage every round and driving the victim berserk with pain. The target gets to save vs. Spell at -4 every round; if successful, the damage and berserk state are negated. This spell does not work against undead or extraplanar creatures that do not have blood (such as elementals). If the creature is resistant to fire, this resistance will lower or nullify the damage from this spell.~
@21424=~Farsight
(Divination)

Level: 4
Range: Special
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: Instant
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

When Farsight is cast, the caster is able to view an area of an unexplored map. After casting the spell, simply click on a section of the map that you want to view. For the duration of the spell, the caster can spy on that area, noting creatures and fortifications.

Farsight has no casting time, can be cast immediately after another spell, and can be cast while the game is paused.~
@21425=~Wizard Eye
(Divination, Alteration)

Level: 4
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is employed, the wizard creates an invisible sensory organ that sends <PRO_HIMHER> visual information. The wizard eye can see with normal vision up to standard visual range and can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. It has substance and a form that can be detected (by a Detect Invisibility spell, for instance). Solid barriers prevent the passage of a wizard eye. The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. A successful Dispel Magic spell cast on the wizard or the eye ends the spell.~
@21427=~Emotion, Courage
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 15 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 7-ft. radius

(Invocation)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 17-ft. cone with 15-deg. arc
Saving Throw: Special

Shout grants the wizard tremendous vocal powers, allowing <PRO_HIMHER> to emit an earsplitting roar from <PRO_HISHER> mouth in a cone-shaped area of effect. Any creature within this area is deafened for 9 rounds and suffers 10d6 points of magic damage. A successful Save vs. Spell negates the deafness and reduces the damage by half. The targets are also knocked back, whether they make the save or not.~
@21503=~Cone of Cold

Level: 5
Range: 100
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

A combination of Dimension Door and Improved Invisibility, Shadow Door creates a door, which the caster steps through. The caster is then teleported to a point of <PRO_HISHER> choice within 100 feet. When <PRO_HESHE> arrives at that spot, <PRO_HESHE> is invisible (as per the Improved Invisibility spell), for the spell's duration. A True Seeing spell, a gem of seeing, or similar magical means can reveal the wizard.~
@21507=~Hold Monster
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell holds 1d4 enemies of any type (except for undead) rigidly immobile. Specifically, it affects the targeted enemy and up to 3 hostile creatures within 10 ft. of it. A successful Save vs. Spell at -2 negates the effect.

Paralyzed creatures are helpless and cannot dodge or defend themselves from attacks. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subject's condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~
@21510=~Spell Immunity
(Abjuration)

Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Casting this spell grants the wizard protection from one spell school of <PRO_HISHER> choice. After the spell is cast, the wizard must choose the school <PRO_HESHE> wishes to be protected from. All spells of this school will not be able to harm or aid the caster for the duration of this spell. Spell Immunity cannot grant protection from Abjuration spells, as it would be paradoxical for Spell Immunity to prevent itself from applying.~
@21515=~Oracle
(Divination)

Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 120-ft. radius

The spells affected are Blur, Reflected Image, Invisibility, Mirror Image, Non-Detection, Improved Invisibility, Shadow Door, Pixie Dust, Mislead, Project Image, and Simulacrum. The caster can control whom this spell affects; thus, it will affect only creatures that are not in the caster's party. A target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.~
@21518=~Phantom Blade
(Evocation)

Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a translucent, shadow-like, weightless area of magical force extending from the fingers of one of the caster's hands. The silent, blade-shaped construct's cutting edges inflict slashing damage just as those of a real sword do. The phantom blade uses the long sword proficiency, but it grants the wielder proficiency in long swords if <PRO_HESHE> has none.

The phantom blade acts as a +3 magical sword and deals 1d10+3 damage, but it also has +20 to hit, since it ignores all defenses. Due to its etheric nature, it causes an extra +10 magic damage against undead creatures. This sword can only be used by the caster and remains in <PRO_HISHER> hand for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~

The shield is still vulnerable to spells that remove spell protections, such as Spell Thrust, Secret Word, Pierce Magic, Ruby Ray, Khelben's Warding Whip, Pierce Shield, and Spellstrike.

Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When the spell is cast, it confers complete invulnerability to all magical weapons. This spell cannot be cast on anyone who is protected from normal weapons or anyone who is protected by Mantle, Improved Mantle, or Absolute Immunity.

Level: 6
Range: Visual range of the caster

Level: 6
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 15 rounds
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 12-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell brings forth a billowing cloud of acidic fog. The thick fog limits movement to 50% of a creature's current movement rate. Exposure to the fog deals 4 acid damage per round, but it also gives a cumulative 50% vulnerability to acid for 11 seconds (after it deals the damage). 

While in the fog, creatures must save vs. Spell every round or suffer -2 to Strength and Dexterity for the duration of that round.~

Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell releases a burst of electrical energy at a target; unlike the Lightning Bolt spell, however, once the bolt strikes the initial target, the electricity then jumps to the next nearest foe, losing a small amount of energy with each additional strike until it is expended. The bolt initially inflicts 1d6 Hit Points of electrical damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 20d6 points of damage. Each jump the bolt makes reduces the damage by 1d6. Each creature that is hit is allowed a Save vs. Spell for half damage.~

When the wizard attacks a creature with the lich's touch, that creature takes 1d2 fist damage (plus Strength bonus) and 3d10 magic cold damage, and the creature must Save vs. Paralysis at -2 or be paralyzed for 3 rounds.

Range: 0
Duration: 5 rounds

This spell creates nine darts that can be used by the caster and cannot be unequipped so long as the spell is in effect. The darts are +3, do 1d4+3 missile damage with +3 to hit, and a creature struck by a dart must Save vs. Death at -6 or take 2d6 magic damage and have its Strength reduced by 3 for 5 rounds. Strength reduction is cumulative, and hitting a single creature with multiple darts can potentially reduce its Strength to 0, killing it instantly. Undead, constructs and extraplanar creatures are immune to the magic damage and Strength reduction from these darts. The caster gains proficiency in darts as long as <PRO_HESHE> has at least one dart remaining, unless <PRO_HESHE> already has a higher level of proficiency in darts.~

This spell conjures forth seven magical orbs that float in a ring above the caster's head. Each eye has a defensive and offensive ability, though once either one is used, the eye will lose its power. Each offensive ability can be cast instantly. The powers of each eye are described below.

Eye of the Mind: This orb protects the caster against mental attacks such as charm, emotion, and fear. The eye can be expended as the 5th-level wizard spell Domination, bringing a creature under the caster's control for 15 rounds (Save vs. Spell at -2 negates).

Eye of the Sword: This eye deflects the first physical damaging attack that strikes the caster. The eye may be expended as the 4th-level wizard spell Mordenkainen's Force Missiles, creating up to 7 missiles that strike the target.

Eye of the Mage: This eye absorbs one manifestation of fire, electrical, cold, or acid damage. The eye can also be expended as the 6th-level wizard spell Chain Lightning, dealing 1d6 electrical damage per level (capped at 20d6) to the first target and bouncing to other creatures for less damage.

Eye of Venom: This eye halts any one attack or effect that could poison the caster. The eye can also be expended as the 5th-level wizard spell Cloudkill.

Eye of Fortitude: This eye blocks one stunning, deafness, blindness, or silence effect. It may alternatively be expended as the 4th-level wizard spell Shout, dealing 10d6 magic damage and deafening and knocking back creatures within a 35-ft. cone (Save vs. Spell halves damage and negates deafness).
