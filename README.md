# Improved-Heart-Of-Fury-Mode
Version 3.5

This is a mod for the game Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition. It will not work on the original version of Icewind Dale.

This mod provides a more interesting version of Icewind Dale's Heart of Fury mode. Enemies are powered up greatly, but usually in other ways than just giving them large amounts of hit points. Like in Icewind Dale 2's HoF mode, most items in the game are empowered.

Version 3.5 makes some of the minor battles in Chapters 2 and 4 easier. I'm aiming on making those chapters less of a grind (I don't want the player to have to rest after every single encounter). A few more spells have been enhanced as well.
