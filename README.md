# Improved-Heart-Of-Fury-Mode
Version 3.2

This is a mod for the game Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition. It will not work on the original version of Icewind Dale.

This mod provides a more interesting version of Icewind Dale's Heart of Fury mode. Enemies are powered up greatly, but usually in other ways than just giving them large amounts of hit points. Like in Icewind Dale 2's HoF mode, most items in the game are empowered.

Version 3.2 fixes some problems with enemy AI. The party is less likely to accidentally trigger another enemy encounter while they're in the middle of one.
