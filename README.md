# Improved-Heart-Of-Fury-Mode
Version 3.4

This is a mod for the game Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition. It will not work on the original version of Icewind Dale.

This mod provides a more interesting version of Icewind Dale's Heart of Fury mode. Enemies are powered up greatly, but usually in other ways than just giving them large amounts of hit points. Like in Icewind Dale 2's HoF mode, most items in the game are empowered.

Version 3.4's main change is that it lets you start Heart of Winter right after beating Belhifet without having to start a new game (which made you lose the items in your containers), and it lets you start Trials of the Luremaster right after beating Icasaracht.
